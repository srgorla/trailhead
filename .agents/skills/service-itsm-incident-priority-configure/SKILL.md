# Configuring the Incident Priority Matrix (sf CLI)

Configures the **Incident Priority Matrix** for Salesforce ITSM — the grid that derives an Incident's **Priority** from its **Impact** and **Urgency**. Covers viewing the matrix, enabling / disabling it, adding / changing / removing / seeding cells, toggling the manual-override preference, and reading / setting the default (fallback) priority.

Every read and write dispatches through the **`sf` CLI**, so this skill works on any org with the Incident Management license enabled.

Writes are **idempotent** (skipped when the current state already matches the target), the skill always **reads before it writes**, and an explicit **confirm-to-write** checkpoint is required before any mutation.

## Scope

- **In scope** (Incident only): view the matrix; enable / disable it; add, change, remove, or
  seed matrix cells; toggle manual override; read / set the default (fallback) priority.
- **Out of scope**: `Problem` and `ChangeRequest` matrices; non-ITSM Priority pickers;
  SLA / milestone / entitlement setup; enabling Incident Management itself. If the user
  asks about `Problem` or `ChangeRequest`, stop and say so.

---

## Preconditions

1. `sf` CLI ≥ 2.60 (verify with `sf --version`).
2. The target org is authenticated with `sf` — one of `sf org list` should show it as `Connected`.
3. Incident Management is enabled on the org — the master pref for the Service Cloud ITSM
   Incident feature (Setup Discovery `apiName = service-cloud-itsm-incident`). Read directly
   at preflight time via `GET /services/data/v67.0/connect/setup/discovery/features` and
   filter to `apiName == "service-cloud-itsm-incident"` (the setup-org-preferences endpoint
   for the master is not exposed on this surface — `IncidentMgmtEnabled` /
   `ITSMIncidentMgmtEnabled` both 404). If `status != "ENABLED"`, delegate to
   `service-itsm-incident-mgmt-configure` inline to enable it (that skill runs its own
   read-before-write + confirm-to-write against the same route), then resume Phase 1.
4. The calling user has `CustomizeApplication` (View Setup + Setup Admin).

If any precondition is unmet, the CLI surfaces the raw error verbatim — **do not fabricate state,
surface the raw error and stop.**

## Routes at a glance

Every route is called through the `sf` CLI. Full method / path / body / response
details, the picklist extraction recipe, and gotchas live in `references/sf-cli-invocation.md`.

| Concern | Transport | HTTP status |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Master Incident Mgmt pref (read) | `sf api request rest` GET on `/services/data/v67.0/connect/setup/discovery/features`, filter `apiName == "service-cloud-itsm-incident"` for `status` | 200 |
| Matrix enable flag (read/write) | `sf api request rest` on `/services/data/v67.0/setup/org/preferences/IncPriorityMatrixEnabled` | 200 |
| Manual override (read/write) | `sf api request rest` on `/services/data/v67.0/setup/org/preferences/IncPriorityOverrideEnabled` | 200 |
| Matrix rows (read) | `sf data query --use-tooling-api` on `ServiceOpPriorityConfig` | 200 |
| Matrix rows (add) | `sf api request rest` POST on `/services/data/v67.0/tooling/sobjects/ServiceOpPriorityConfig` | 201 |
| Matrix rows (change) | `sf api request rest` PATCH on `/services/data/v67.0/tooling/sobjects/ServiceOpPriorityConfig/<Id>` | 204 |
| Matrix rows (remove) | `sf data delete record --use-tooling-api` on `ServiceOpPriorityConfig` | 200 |
| Default fallback priority (read) | `sf api request rest` GET on `/services/data/v67.0/tooling/query/?q=...StandardValueSet...` | 200 |
| Default fallback priority (write) | `sf project retrieve start` + edit + `sf project deploy start` on `StandardValueSet:IncidentPriority` | deploy Succeeded |
| Picklist values (Incident) | `sf api request rest` GET on `/services/data/v67.0/sobjects/Incident/describe` | 200 |
| Salesforce Go step "Done" (write, after a mutation) | `sf api request rest` PUT on `/services/data/v67.0/connect/setup/discovery/feature/service-cloud-itsm-incident/configuration/step/definePriorityMatrix/progress` | 200 |

**Path prefixes are load-bearing — do NOT strip them.** Setup Connect API paths MUST start with
`/services/data/v67.0/`. Tooling REST paths MUST start with `/services/data/v67.0/tooling/`.

## Clarifying Questions

Ask only what you cannot infer:

- **Which org?** `sf` CLI alias or username (`--target-org <alias>`). Default: the org's default target.
- **What operation?** View; enable / disable the matrix; toggle manual override; set the default priority; add / change / remove a cell; seed a full matrix.
- **For add / change:** the `Impact` + `Urgency` coordinates and the resulting `Priority` (validated against the fetched picklist values).
- **For set-default-priority:** the target Priority value. If the user did **not** name one, dispatch `AskUserQuestion` with the org's active `Incident.Priority` picklist values as options — never guess.

---

## Workflow

All steps are sequential. **Always read before you write.** All calls go through `sf` CLI.

### Phase 0 — Reuse what the session already knows

Each Phase 1 / Phase 2 read below carries a **skip-if-already-known** clause. Before
calling any `sf` command, check whether an earlier turn in this session already produced
the same fact **from a successful `sf` invocation tied to the current `--target-org`**
(a prior run of this skill, or an earlier `sf` call in the same conversation). Session
context here is per `--target-org <alias>`, so a different alias is a different session.
**An explicit user statement is NOT cache-eligible** — the picklist values, pref
booleans, matrix rows, and fallback priority all drive client-side validation and
duplicate prevention on Phase-4 mutations, so a mistaken or stale user assertion can
bypass those safeguards and create invalid or duplicate rows. When the only source is
a user statement (or you cannot identify a specific prior `sf` response), re-read.

- **`sf --version`** — if the CLI version was already reported this session, skip step 1.
- **Incident `describe` (active `Impact` / `Urgency` / `Priority` picklists)** — if the
  Incident describe was already read for the current `--target-org` this session and the
  three picklists are in context, skip step 2 and reuse them.
- **`IncPriorityMatrixEnabled` / `IncPriorityOverrideEnabled` pref values** — if either
  was already read this session AND has not been PATCHed since, skip its Phase-2 read.
- **`ServiceOpPriorityConfig` rows** — if the current-org Incident rows were already
  read this session AND no `POST` / `PATCH` / `delete` on `ServiceOpPriorityConfig` has
  been dispatched since, skip step 5 and reuse the row list.
- **`StandardValueSet:IncidentPriority` default** — if the fallback priority was already
  read this session AND no `StandardValueSet:IncidentPriority` deploy has run since,
  skip step 6.

**When in doubt, re-check.** Skip only when the fact is unambiguously in context, the
`--target-org` alias is unchanged, and no Phase-4 write since (a pref PATCH, a
`ServiceOpPriorityConfig` POST/PATCH/delete, or a `StandardValueSet:IncidentPriority`
deploy) could have invalidated it. A wrong skip on a live org is worse than a re-read.

### Phase 1 — Preflight

1. *(Skip if `sf --version` was already reported this session — see Phase 0.)* `sf --version` to confirm the CLI is available.
2. **Master Incident Management pref — direct read** *(Skip only if the master pref was
   already read this session for the current `--target-org` AND the value was `ENABLED`
   AND no write elsewhere in this session could have flipped it — see Phase 0.)* `sf api request rest "/services/data/v67.0/connect/setup/discovery/features" --method GET --target-org <alias>`. Parse the response and filter the `features[]` array to the element where `apiName == "service-cloud-itsm-incident"`; read its `status` field. If `status == "ENABLED"`, proceed to step 3. **If `status != "ENABLED"`, delegate to `service-itsm-incident-mgmt-configure` inline to enable the master pref** (that skill runs its own confirm-to-write against the same route), then re-read this step to verify `status == "ENABLED"` before continuing. If the delegation is declined by the user, halt — Priority Matrix cannot function while the master is off. This is a **direct read of the master pref**, not a proxy — the Incident describe check that follows is a secondary sanity check, not the master-state signal.
3. *(Skip if the Incident describe for the current `--target-org` — including active `Impact` / `Urgency` / `Priority` picklists — is already in context this session — see Phase 0.)* `sf api request rest "/services/data/v67.0/sobjects/Incident/describe" --method GET --target-org <alias>`. A **200** with `Impact` / `Urgency` / `Priority` picklist fields is a secondary sanity check. Extract active picklist values for later validation. If the describe response is large, dispatch a subagent (haiku tier) to extract just the three picklists.

### Phase 2 — Show current state (read-only)

Dispatch these reads (all expected to return 200):

3. *(Skip if `IncPriorityMatrixEnabled` for the current `--target-org` was already read this session AND has not been PATCHed since — see Phase 0.)* `sf api request rest "/services/data/v67.0/setup/org/preferences/IncPriorityMatrixEnabled" --method GET --target-org <alias>` — matrix enable flag. Body: `{"isPreferenceEnabled": <bool>}`.
4. *(Skip if `IncPriorityOverrideEnabled` for the current `--target-org` was already read this session AND has not been PATCHed since — see Phase 0.)* `sf api request rest "/services/data/v67.0/setup/org/preferences/IncPriorityOverrideEnabled" --method GET --target-org <alias>` — manual-override flag. Same body shape.
5. *(Skip if the Incident `ServiceOpPriorityConfig` rows for the current `--target-org` were already read this session AND no POST / PATCH / delete on this SObject has been dispatched since — see Phase 0.)* Matrix rows — `sf data query --use-tooling-api --target-org <alias> --query "SELECT Id, DeveloperName, ReferenceObject, Urgency, Impact, Priority FROM ServiceOpPriorityConfig WHERE ReferenceObject = 'Incident'"`. Returns zero or more rows. `DeveloperName` is required so the add step can derive a fresh unique suffix.
6. *(Skip if the `StandardValueSet:IncidentPriority` default was already read this session AND no `StandardValueSet:IncidentPriority` deploy has run since — see Phase 0.)* Default fallback priority — `sf api request rest "/services/data/v67.0/tooling/query/?q=SELECT+Id,MasterLabel,Metadata+FROM+StandardValueSet+WHERE+MasterLabel='IncidentPriority'" --method GET --target-org <alias>`. Read `records[0].Metadata.standardValue`, find the entry with `default: true`, take its `valueName` — that is the fallback priority.

Format the rows as an Impact × Urgency grid (see `examples/render-matrix.md`). Steps 3–6 together are the "view" operation and the before-snapshot.

**Duplicate-coordinate detection (load-bearing for Change / Remove):** group the Phase-2 rows by `(ReferenceObject, Urgency, Impact)`. If any group has more than one row, the matrix already contains duplicates (the server does not enforce uniqueness). For every operation whose target coordinate is duplicated, halt Phase 3 for that concern — do NOT ask the user to confirm a Change or Remove until they either name an explicit `Id` or approve a consolidation plan (see `Phase 4 → Change a cell` and `Phase 4 → Remove a cell`). Add is unaffected — the Phase-4 add path already refuses any coordinate already present in the snapshot.

### Phase 3 — Confirm target (`AskUserQuestion`, REQUIRED before any write)

Present the intended change as `(Concern: <before> → <after>)` and require an explicit "yes" via `AskUserQuestion`. Proceed to Phase 4 **only** on explicit "yes". On "no", stop and report the current state without writing.

### Phase 4 — Apply the change (skip for view-only)

Read the current value of the same concern first (Phase 2 covers this), confirm the target with the user (Phase 3), then dispatch. Payload shapes and full CLI invocations for every operation live in `examples/matrix-operations.md`.

- **Enable / disable the matrix** — `sf api request rest` PATCH on `IncPriorityMatrixEnabled` with body `{"desiredState": <bool>}`. PATCH response echoes `{"isPreferenceEnabled": <bool>}`; no separate re-read needed.
- **Toggle manual override** — `sf api request rest` PATCH on `IncPriorityOverrideEnabled` with body `{"desiredState": <bool>}`. Does **not** touch matrix rows or the default priority.
- **Add a cell** — `sf api request rest` POST on `/services/data/v67.0/tooling/sobjects/ServiceOpPriorityConfig` with body `{"ReferenceObject": "Incident", "Urgency": "<val>", "Impact": "<val>", "Priority": "<val>", "DeveloperName": "<unique>", "MasterLabel": "<same>"}`. Payload must have `ReferenceObject == "Incident"` — the SObject is shared with Problem / ChangeRequest and the server accepts any string. Validate every `Urgency` / `Impact` / `Priority` against the fetched picklists first — the Tooling endpoint does NOT enforce picklist validation. Deduplicate against the Phase-2 snapshot: the server does NOT reject duplicates on `(ReferenceObject, Urgency, Impact)`, so a second POST on the same coordinate silently persists as a second row and the runtime picks between them non-deterministically.
- **Change a cell** — read Phase-2 rows, find the row(s) matching `(ReferenceObject=Incident, Urgency, Impact)`. If **exactly one row matches**, `sf api request rest` PATCH on `/services/data/v67.0/tooling/sobjects/ServiceOpPriorityConfig/<Id>` with body `{"Priority": "<new val>"}`. If **zero rows match**, this is an add — not a change; surface and ask. If **more than one row matches** (duplicates were detected in Phase 2), do NOT dispatch — report the duplicate rows with their `Id` / `DeveloperName` / current `Priority`, and require the user to either name the exact `Id` to change or approve a consolidation plan (delete the extras, then change the survivor).
- **Remove a cell** — read Phase-2 rows, find the row(s) matching `(ReferenceObject=Incident, Urgency, Impact)`. If **exactly one row matches**, `sf data delete record --sobject ServiceOpPriorityConfig --record-id <Id> --use-tooling-api --target-org <alias>`. If **zero rows match**, short-circuit with "nothing to remove". If **more than one row matches**, do NOT dispatch — report the duplicates and require the user to either name the exact `Id`(s) to remove or explicitly confirm "remove all rows at this coordinate".
- **Seed a full matrix** — see `examples/seed-full-matrix.md`. Validate values first, then POST each row.
- **Set the default fallback priority** — `sf project retrieve start --metadata "StandardValueSet:IncidentPriority" --target-org <alias>`, edit the file to set `<default>true</default>` on the target value and `<default>false</default>` on every other, then `sf project deploy start --metadata "StandardValueSet:IncidentPriority" --target-org <alias> --wait 10`. Verify with `Succeeded` in the deploy result.

### Phase 5 — Verify and present

7. Re-read the concern that was mutated (matrix rows via Tooling SOQL; default priority via `StandardValueSet` query; prefs are echoed on PATCH response). If the observed state does not match the requested state, treat it as a failed write and report the raw server response verbatim.
8. **Mark the Salesforce Go step Done — only if a Phase-4 functional write actually landed.** The "Define Priority Matrix" step is user-override: its checkmark is **not** derived from org state, so configuring the matrix alone never flips it — completion must be written. After step 7 verifies the write, PUT the completion once (`references/sf-cli-invocation.md` route 10; body `{"isComplete": true}`, flag REQUIRED). It rides on the Phase-3 confirmation — no separate `AskUserQuestion`. **Skip entirely on view-only reads and idempotent no-ops.**
9. Present before/after (Impact × Urgency grid via `examples/render-matrix.md`) plus a one-line summary (e.g. `Incident matrix: High/High → Critical added`). Matrix changes affect only Incidents created **after** the write; disabling the matrix does not clear stored rows or the default priority.

## Rules / Constraints

| Constraint | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| All operations run through `sf` CLI | Works on any org with Incident Management enabled; requires no additional setup |
| Always API v67.0 minimum | The Setup Connect API pref routes require v67+ |
| Read live state before writing | The Phase-2 snapshot is the source of truth for the confirmation prompt, the idempotency check, and the Phase-5 verify |
| **REQUIRED confirm-to-write checkpoint** before any mutation | Toggling prefs or changing matrix rows mutates org state; user must approve the exact plan |
| Idempotent — skip the write when the current state already matches the requested state | Avoids no-op writes; see `references/sf-cli-invocation.md` for the exact match rule per concern |
| Validate every `Impact`, `Urgency`, `Priority` against the org's live picklist before dispatch | The Tooling REST endpoint does NOT enforce picklist validation; the runtime matrix evaluator does. Skipping this validation lets garbage rows into the matrix |
| Deduplicate rows client-side against the Phase-2 snapshot before add | The server does NOT enforce `(ReferenceObject, Urgency, Impact)` uniqueness — a second POST on the same coordinate persists as a separate row. Client-side dedup is the only guard against duplicate cells. |
| Refuse any `ReferenceObject` other than `Incident` (`Problem`, `ChangeRequest`, anything else) | `ServiceOpPriorityConfig` is shared with the Problem / ChangeRequest matrices at the wire level — the server accepts any `ReferenceObject` string. Scope to `Incident` is skill-enforced only. |
| On Change / Remove, if the target coordinate resolves to more than one row, do NOT dispatch — require an explicit `Id` or a confirmed consolidation plan | The server allows duplicate `(ReferenceObject, Urgency, Impact)` rows. Picking "the row Id" arbitrarily would mutate one duplicate and leave the other in place, keeping the matrix non-deterministic. |
| Report exact error text from the CLI response | The CLI surfaces the underlying error message verbatim |
| After a functional write, PUT the Salesforce Go step-progress completion (route 10); skip on view / no-op | The "Define Priority Matrix" step is user-override — its checkmark isn't derived from org state, so config writes alone leave the Go checklist stuck |

---

## Verification Checklist

Before reporting completion of any mutation, confirm each of the following. If any item is unchecked, do not report success — surface what is missing.

- [ ] Phase 1 preflight (`sf api request rest` on Incident describe) returned 200 with active `Impact` / `Urgency` / `Priority` picklists; if 404, the raw error was surfaced and the run halted.
- [ ] Phase 2 read against every concern the write plans to touch returned 200 (or a raw error was surfaced) and each observed value was recorded as the "before" state. For Change / Remove, the Phase-2 rows were grouped by `(ReferenceObject, Urgency, Impact)` and any duplicate coordinates on the mutation target were surfaced to the user — no Change / Remove was dispatched until an explicit `Id` or a confirmed consolidation plan resolved the duplication.
- [ ] Phase 3 confirm-to-write presented `(<concern>: <current> → <requested>)` via `AskUserQuestion` and the user replied with an explicit "yes" — no write dispatched on any other response (silence, "maybe", "looks good", implicit approval).
- [ ] Idempotency: if the current state already matched the requested state, Phase 4 was skipped for that concern and reported as an idempotent no-op — no write was dispatched.
- [ ] Every `Impact`, `Urgency`, `Priority` in any add / change payload was validated against the Phase-1 picklist values before dispatch. Duplicates on `(ReferenceObject, Urgency, Impact)` were caught client-side against the Phase-2 snapshot — the server does NOT reject duplicates. Every add payload had `ReferenceObject == "Incident"`.
- [ ] Phase 4 writes used the exact CLI invocations from `references/sf-cli-invocation.md`; on any `4xx` / `5xx` (or non-`Succeeded` deploy), the raw response was surfaced and the run halted.
- [ ] Phase 5 verify re-read the affected concerns; any diff was reported as `write FAILED — server state differs from request` with the raw response.
- [ ] If a Phase-4 functional write landed, the Go step-progress completion PUT (route 10) was sent after verify. On view-only reads and idempotent no-ops, no completion PUT was dispatched.
- [ ] The final report gave a before/after with the Impact × Urgency grid and a one-line summary.
