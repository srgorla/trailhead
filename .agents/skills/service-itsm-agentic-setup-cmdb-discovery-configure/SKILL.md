# Enable CMDB Asset Discovery (Service Cloud ITSM)

Turns on **Asset Discovery** for CMDB by enabling the `service-cloud-itsm-discovery-integration`
feature, then grants a user access to the **Discovery page** by assigning the **IT Service Discovery
Manager** permission set (and its permission-set license). This is the **final layer** of CMDB setup —
it runs only after the base CMDB feature is enabled, users have CMDB access, and the CMDB Foundation
content bundle is installed. Every call runs through the **Salesforce-hosted Headless-360 MCP server**
(server key `headless-360`) via its four meta-tools (`discover`, `describe`, `dispatch_readonly`,
`dispatch`). The org is derived from the OAuth JWT bound to the current MCP session — the skill never
handles an org id, alias, or credentials — so this works identically against **production** and sandbox
with no per-user MCP install.

This skill covers the **Discovery layer only** — enabling the feature *and* granting Discovery page
access to a user. The earlier CMDB layers are separate skills — see the end of this file.

## Where this sits in the CMDB stack

CMDB is enabled in ordered layers, each gated on the prior one:

```text
Layer 0  Org SKU / license      Org perm ITSrvcsCnfgMgmnt (verify only — no API can set it).
Layer 1  Tenant provisioning    ITOM tenant must reach status PROVISIONED (async).
Layer 2  CMDB feature           Enable service-cloud-itsm-cmdb-integration (lifts the 403 gate).
Layer 3  User access            Assign the PSL + CMDB permission sets to the user(s).
Layer 4  Content bundle         Install the CMDB Foundation (base) content bundle.
Layer 5  Asset Discovery        Enable service-cloud-itsm-discovery-integration + assign the
                                IT Service Discovery Manager permission set  ← THIS SKILL
```

Discovery is enabled **last**: it builds on the base CMDB feature and depends on the earlier layers
being complete. The pre-check step below (`enableBlockedReasons`) is the authoritative signal that
the prerequisites are met — if the base CMDB feature is not yet enabled, discovery cannot be enabled
and the org reports a blocking reason rather than turning it on.

> **Enabling the feature lifts the org-level gate; the Discovery permission set gives a user the
> Discovery page.** This skill does **both**: it turns Discovery on for the org (Step 2) and then
> assigns the target user the license-backed **`ItSrvcDscvrMgrPermissionSet`** ("IT Service Discovery
> Manager", backed by PSL **`ItSrvcDscvrMgrPsl`**) so they can actually open and use the Discovery
> page (Steps 4–7). That permission set is **distinct** from the four Configuration-Item permission
> sets (Reader / Owner / Type Reader / Type Manager) that `service-itsm-agentic-setup-cmdb-access-assign`
> assigns for CMDB *data* — a user holding only those will **not** have Discovery page access. The
> assignment step is idempotent: if the user already holds the Discovery permission set and its license,
> it is skipped and reported as already-done.

## Scope

- **In scope**: pre-checking, enabling, and verifying the `service-cloud-itsm-discovery-integration`
  feature; and — as a follow-up — assigning the **IT Service Discovery Manager** permission set (and its
  permission-set license) to the target user so they can access the Discovery page.
- **Out of scope**: enabling the base CMDB feature / provisioning the tenant (Layer 2 —
  `service-itsm-agentic-setup-cmdb-configure`), assigning the four Configuration-Item permission sets
  for CMDB *data* access (Layer 3 — `service-itsm-agentic-setup-cmdb-access-assign`), bundle
  installation (Layer 4 — `service-itsm-agentic-setup-cmdb-bundle-deploy`), CMDB record CRUD, Service
  Graph Connector configuration, identification rules, creating or editing permission sets.

## Mechanism

All operations dispatch through **headless-360** MCP tools. Reads go through
`mcp__headless-360__dispatch_readonly`, writes through `mcp__headless-360__dispatch` — both take raw
HTTP: `{"url": "<path>", "method": "GET|POST", "body"?: {...}, "queryParams"?: {...}}` — **not**
`{operation_id, arguments}`. See `references/mcp-invocation.md` for the exact `url` / `method` /
`body` of every call. The four tools:

- `mcp__headless-360__discover` — semantic search over the indexed operation catalog. The Setup/Connect
  routes and the `/query` / `/sobjects/...` REST routes this skill uses are not always ranked first (or
  indexed), so a miss does **not** mean the route is absent — dispatch the exact path directly (see
  `references/mcp-invocation.md`).
- `mcp__headless-360__describe` — pull the full input schema and canonical route before any POST.
- `mcp__headless-360__dispatch_readonly` — the dispatcher for every read (GET).
- `mcp__headless-360__dispatch` — the dispatcher for every write (POST/PATCH).

The skill never handles credentials — the org is bound to the current OAuth session. If a `dispatch*`
call returns an auth error, tell the user to re-authenticate the headless-360 MCP connection (and
confirm the session points at the intended org), then stop.

## The Discovery permission set

| Role | Permission set (`Name`) | Backing PSL (`DeveloperName`) | Grants |
|------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|--------|
| Discovery Manager | `ItSrvcDscvrMgrPermissionSet` | `ItSrvcDscvrMgrPsl` | Open and use the Discovery page |

Resolve the permission set's `Id` and its `LicenseId` at runtime (Step 5) rather than hardcoding IDs —
IDs differ per org.

---

## Clarifying questions

Ask only what you cannot infer from conversation:

- **Which org?** Confirm the target org and state plainly that **this org will be modified** (enabling
  the discovery feature is a write). For production, get explicit confirmation.
- **Which user gets Discovery page access?** The user to assign the IT Service Discovery Manager role.
  If the request is "enable discovery for me" / "set up discovery", default to the **current (running)
  user**. Accept a username/email for someone else.

Do not re-ask for anything the user already provided; pre-populate and note "(from conversation)".

---

## Workflow

All steps are sequential and gated — **do not advance past a failed check.** Always read before you
write: run the read-only pre-check before the enable, and the assignment checks before the assign.

### Step 1 — Pre-check discovery feature status (read)

The feature api name is `service-cloud-itsm-discovery-integration`.

```text
dispatch_readonly({ "url": "/services/data/v67.0/connect/setup/discovery/feature/service-cloud-itsm-discovery-integration/status", "method": "GET" })
```

- `status == ENABLED` → feature already on; skip to verification (Step 3), then proceed to the access
  follow-up (Steps 4–7).
- `status == NOT_ENABLED` with `enableBlockedReasons: []` → clear to enable (Step 2).
- `enableBlockedReasons` non-empty → **STOP** and relay each reason to the user in plain language.
  These are prerequisites the org still needs — most commonly the base CMDB feature is not yet
  enabled. Point the user to the earlier CMDB setup skills (see "Common failures") and do **not**
  attempt the enable.
- `403 FUNCTIONALITY_NOT_ENABLED` on this GET → the base CMDB gate itself is still closed; the org
  needs `service-itsm-agentic-setup-cmdb-configure` first. Stop and route the user there.

### Step 2 — Enable Asset Discovery (write — confirm with the user first)

Skip this step if Step 1 already reported `ENABLED`.

```text
dispatch({ "url": "/services/data/v67.0/connect/setup/discovery/feature/service-cloud-itsm-discovery-integration/enable", "method": "POST", "body": {} })
→ {"success": true}
```

### Step 3 — Verify the feature (read — do NOT trust the POST response alone)

```text
dispatch_readonly({ "url": "/services/data/v67.0/connect/setup/discovery/feature/service-cloud-itsm-discovery-integration/status", "method": "GET" })
→ expect status == ENABLED
```

**`status == ENABLED` is the definitive confirmation that the feature is on.** Once confirmed, continue
to the access follow-up below — the feature being on does not by itself give any user the Discovery page.

### Step 4 — Resolve the target user (read)

**For "the current user" / "me" / "set up discovery"** (do NOT use `USER_ID()` — Apex-only, rejected by
the REST query API; do NOT rely on `/chatter/users/me` or `/connect/user-profiles/me` — they `403` when
Chatter/Communities are off). Read the API root and parse the identity URL:

```text
dispatch_readonly({ "url": "/services/data/v67.0/", "method": "GET" })
```

The response `identity` field is a URL ending in `/<orgId>/<userId>` (the user Id is the last path
segment and starts with `005`). Use that Id directly, or confirm it with a `User` query.

**For a named user** (username / email supplied):

```text
dispatch_readonly({ "url": "/services/data/v67.0/query", "method": "GET", "queryParams": { "q": "SELECT Id, Username, Name, IsActive FROM User WHERE Username = '<username>'" } })
```

- Exactly one active user → capture the `Id`.
- Zero results → STOP; ask the user to confirm the username.
- More than one → STOP; list the candidates (Name + Username) and ask which one.

### Step 5 — Resolve the Discovery permission set + check existing assignment (read — idempotency)

Resolve the permission set and its backing license:

```text
dispatch_readonly({ "url": "/services/data/v67.0/query", "method": "GET", "queryParams": { "q": "SELECT Id, Name, LicenseId FROM PermissionSet WHERE Name = 'ItSrvcDscvrMgrPermissionSet'" } })
```

Capture `Id` (the permission set) and `LicenseId` (the PSL to assign). `totalSize == 0` means the org
is not licensed for Discovery — stop and report. Then check whether the user already has both:

```text
dispatch_readonly({ "url": "/services/data/v67.0/query", "method": "GET", "queryParams": { "q": "SELECT Id FROM PermissionSetAssignment WHERE AssigneeId = '<userId>' AND PermissionSetId = '<psId>'" } })
dispatch_readonly({ "url": "/services/data/v67.0/query", "method": "GET", "queryParams": { "q": "SELECT Id FROM PermissionSetLicenseAssign WHERE AssigneeId = '<userId>' AND PermissionSetLicenseId = '<pslId>'" } })
```

If both already exist, the role is **already assigned** — skip Step 6 and record it as already-done.

### Step 6 — Assign the license, then the permission set (write — confirm first)

Skip whatever Step 5 shows already assigned. Assign the PSL **first**, then the permission set:

```text
dispatch({ "url": "/services/data/v67.0/sobjects/PermissionSetLicenseAssign", "method": "POST", "body": { "AssigneeId": "<userId>", "PermissionSetLicenseId": "<pslId>" } })
dispatch({ "url": "/services/data/v67.0/sobjects/PermissionSetAssignment", "method": "POST", "body": { "AssigneeId": "<userId>", "PermissionSetId": "<psId>" } })
```

- `201` → assigned.
- `400 DUPLICATE_VALUE` → the user already had it; treat as success (idempotent), not a failure.
- A license-limit / no-seats error → STOP for the assignment; tell the user the Discovery license has
  no available seats (see `references/mcp-invocation.md` for the seat query). Do not retry.

### Step 7 — Verify the assignment (read — do NOT trust the POST response alone)

Re-run the two Step 5 assignment queries. The user has Discovery page access only when **both** the
`PermissionSetAssignment` and the `PermissionSetLicenseAssign` return `totalSize == 1`.

## Rules / Constraints

| Constraint | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| Run only after the base CMDB feature is enabled | Discovery is the final layer and depends on Layers 0–4; the pre-check `enableBlockedReasons` enforces this |
| Read the pre-check before enabling; verify with a read after enabling | The feature is stateful; the POST response can lag the real state |
| Do not attempt the enable when `enableBlockedReasons` is non-empty | Those are unmet prerequisites — relay them and route the user to the earlier CMDB skills |
| Always follow the enable with the Discovery-Manager assignment | The feature being on does not give any user the Discovery page; the permission set is what grants page access |
| Resolve the user to exactly one record before assigning | Assigning to the wrong (or an ambiguous) user is hard to reverse and a security concern |
| Read existing assignments before assigning; assign the PSL before the permission set | The permission set is license-backed and per-user — re-assigning throws `DUPLICATE_VALUE`; the license seat must be held for the assignment to stick |
| Treat `DUPLICATE_VALUE` as success | It means the user already has that access — idempotent, not an error |
| Never create or edit permission sets | This skill only *assigns* the standard Discovery permission set |
| Confirm the target org, user, and each write with the user | These are real, hard-to-reverse changes on a live org |
| Never expose internal jargon to the user | Keep record IDs, org IDs, HTTP status codes (403/500/…), API error codes (`FUNCTIONALITY_NOT_ENABLED`, `DUPLICATE_VALUE`, …), object names (`PermissionSetLicenseAssign`), endpoint names, feature api names (`service-cloud-itsm-discovery-integration`), developer names (`ItSrvcsCnfgMgmnt`, `ItSrvcDscvrMgrPsl`, …), and tooling internals (`dispatch`, `headless-360`) out of user-facing output. Translate to plain language; use human-readable names and statuses |

---

## Verification checklist

- [ ] Step 1: pre-check showed `enableBlockedReasons: []` before enabling (or `status == ENABLED` already)?
- [ ] Step 2: enable returned `success: true` (or skipped because already enabled)?
- [ ] Step 3: verification GET shows `status == ENABLED`?
- [ ] Step 4: target user resolved to exactly one record?
- [ ] Step 5: Discovery permission set + license resolved; existing assignment checked (idempotency)?
- [ ] Step 6: for the target user, both the permission set and its license are assigned (or already were)?
- [ ] Step 7: assignment confirmed by a post-write read (not the POST response alone)?
- [ ] Confirmed the target org, user, and each write with the user first?

## Output expectations

```text
CMDB Asset Discovery — Complete (via service-itsm-agentic-setup-cmdb-discovery-configure)

Target org: <org>
User: <name> (<username>)

  Asset Discovery ................... Enabled
  IT Service Discovery Manager ...... Assigned    (or: Already had access)

Asset Discovery is now enabled on this org and the user above can open and use the
Discovery page. This completes CMDB setup — the base feature, user access, content
bundle, and discovery are all in place.

To give additional users the Discovery page, re-run this and name each user (or use
service-itsm-agentic-setup-cmdb-access-assign for the underlying CMDB data roles).
```

Keep internal jargon out of user-facing output (no record IDs, HTTP status codes, error codes, object,
endpoint or developer names) — say "IT Service Discovery Manager access", not the developer name. If any
step fails, stop and tell the user — in plain language — which part didn't succeed and what it means for
them, then point to the relevant fix. Translate any raw error (e.g. a 403 or `FUNCTIONALITY_NOT_ENABLED`)
into what it means ("CMDB isn't fully set up yet"), rather than echoing the code.

---

## Common failures (surface these in plain language)

| Symptom | Likely cause | What to tell the user |
|---------|--------------|-----------------------|
| Pre-check `enableBlockedReasons` non-empty | An earlier CMDB layer is incomplete (most often the base CMDB feature) | Relay each reason; finish CMDB setup first — run `service-itsm-agentic-setup-cmdb-configure` (base feature), then `-access-assign` (user access) and `-bundle-deploy` (content bundle), then retry discovery |
| `403 FUNCTIONALITY_NOT_ENABLED` on the status GET | Base CMDB gate still closed (CMDB feature not enabled) | Not a discovery failure — enable the base CMDB feature first with `service-itsm-agentic-setup-cmdb-configure`, then retry |
| Enable blocked (`enableBlockedReasons` non-empty) after a partial setup | Missing dependency the org still needs | Relay each reason; resolve those prerequisites, then retry |
| Enable returned success but verification GET is not `ENABLED` | State lag or a downstream issue | Re-run the verification GET after a short wait; if it persists, treat it as not enabled and investigate |
| `PermissionSet` query `totalSize == 0` for `ItSrvcDscvrMgrPermissionSet` | Org not licensed for Discovery | Discovery access is not available on this org; confirm it is licensed |
| `400 DUPLICATE_VALUE` on the assignment | User already has Discovery page access | Not an error — report the role as already assigned |
| License-limit / no-seats error on the assignment | Discovery permission-set license seats exhausted | Report seats in use vs available; a seat must free up (or more licenses added) before assigning |
| Discovery is `ENABLED` and the feature turned on, but a user still can't open the Discovery page | The user was never assigned the Discovery permission set (`ItSrvcDscvrMgrPermissionSet` / PSL `ItSrvcDscvrMgrPsl`) | Re-run this skill for that user (Steps 4–7) to grant "IT Service Discovery Manager" access |
| `dispatch*` auth error | headless-360 MCP session not authenticated / token expired | Re-authenticate the headless-360 MCP connection and confirm the session points at the intended org |

---

## Cross-skill integration

| When | Skill |
|------|-------|
| The base CMDB feature is not enabled yet (Discovery pre-check is blocked) | `service-itsm-agentic-setup-cmdb-configure` (Layers 0–2 — enable the base feature first, then return here) |
| A user needs the underlying CMDB **data** roles (Configuration Item Reader / Owner / Type Reader / Type Manager) | `service-itsm-agentic-setup-cmdb-access-assign` (Layer 3 — CMDB data access, distinct from Discovery page access) |

---

## Reference file index

| File | When to read |
|------|--------------|
| `references/mcp-invocation.md` | Exact `dispatch*` url/method/body for the pre-check, enable, verify, user resolution, and Discovery-Manager assignment calls, response envelopes, the license-seat query, and error table |
