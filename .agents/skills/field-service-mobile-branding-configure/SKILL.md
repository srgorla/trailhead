# Field Service Mobile Branding

This skill ingests a brand source and produces a 14-field color scheme that gets applied to the org-default `FieldServiceMobileSettings` record (`DeveloperName='Field_Service_Mobile_Settings'`, `IsDefault=true`). Confirmation with the user happens between derivation and apply — never apply without approval.

> **Source:** This skill was authored by Chad Barbour and is mirrored from an
> upstream Field Service assets repository.
> Methodology, color tables, and contrast checks are unchanged from upstream — refresh from upstream when content changes there.

> **Runtime contract:** every org interaction in this skill is a single REST
> call dispatched through the Codey runtime (`dispatch` locally / the hosted
> Headless 360 MCP in shared surfaces). This skill has **no dependency on the
> execution environment** — no `sf` CLI, no shell scripts, no local Python, no
> temp files. Colors are derived and validated by the agent inline, then
> written with one sObject PATCH. Do not shell out.

## Input contract

One of:

- A website URL — fetch with `WebFetch`, extract dominant brand colors.
- A brand-guide paste or document — parse for hex codes and named colors.
- Direct hex codes — accept as-is.
- A color description (e.g. "we're a red and white company") — ask for at least one specific hex code or URL before proceeding.

See [reference/derivation-methodology.md](reference/derivation-methodology.md) for the four ingestion cases (A–D) in detail.

## Output

A 14-field color scheme written to the org-default `FieldServiceMobileSettings` record via a single sObject PATCH (`PATCH /services/data/vXX.0/sobjects/FieldServiceMobileSettings/{id}`). Color changes appear on devices after the metadata cache refreshes (default: 7 days, force-refreshable from app Settings).

## Workflow

### 1. Confirm the target org

**Before fetching the brand source**, confirm the org is reachable with a cheap auth probe — dispatch `SELECT Id FROM Organization LIMIT 1` (`GET /services/data/vXX.0/query`):

- 2xx with `totalSize=1` → the session token is live; continue.
- 401/403 → the org needs re-authentication. Surface that to the user and **stop**; do not proceed to apply.

Then ask: "Which org should I apply this to?" and wait for explicit confirmation before proceeding. Do not assume a default — even if the user mentioned an org name in their request, confirm it explicitly so there are no surprises. (The Codey runtime resolves the connected org; this skill does not manage org aliases.)

### 2. Ingest the brand source

Follow the cases (A–D) in [reference/derivation-methodology.md](reference/derivation-methodology.md). At the end of this step you should have two anchors:

- **Primary brand color** — for non-interactive surfaces and the navbar.
- **Secondary/interactive color** — for buttons, links, FAB.

### 3. Derive the full 14-field scheme

Apply the derivation rules in [reference/derivation-methodology.md](reference/derivation-methodology.md) and the field semantics in [reference/color-fields.md](reference/color-fields.md).

Hold the scheme in memory as a flat object whose keys match the 14 `FieldServiceMobileSettings` color fields. Use [examples/salesforce-default-scheme.json](examples/salesforce-default-scheme.json) as a template. Before continuing, self-check that all 14 fields are present and every value matches `^#[0-9A-Fa-f]{6}$` (6-digit hex, `#` prefix — 3-digit shorthand and missing `#` are invalid); fix any that don't before proposing.

### 4. Validate contrast (light + dark mode)

Compute the WCAG AA contrast ratio for each pair in [reference/contrast-validation.md](reference/contrast-validation.md) **inline** — this is deterministic arithmetic on the hex values you already hold, not an external tool. For each `#RRGGBB` pair:

1. Normalize each channel: `r = R/255, g = G/255, b = B/255`.
2. Linearize each channel: `c ≤ 0.03928 → c/12.92`, else `((c+0.055)/1.055)^2.4`.
3. Relative luminance: `L = 0.2126·r + 0.7152·g + 0.0722·b`.
4. Contrast ratio: `(L_lighter + 0.05) / (L_darker + 0.05)`.

Evaluate all 5 light-mode pairs and all 5 dark-mode pairs from [reference/contrast-validation.md](reference/contrast-validation.md); a pair PASSES at `≥ 4.5:1` (WCAG AA, normal text). Surface any FAIL pairs to the user with a suggested fix in step 5. Note that brand colors are fixed across both modes, so a passing light-mode scheme can still fail dark-mode pairs.

### 5. Present proposal & confirm

Show the user:

- A `Brand & Navigation` / `Contrast Scale` / `Feedback Colors` table of all 14 fields with their hex values and roles.
- The light-mode and dark-mode contrast results from step 4, with FAIL pairs flagged.
- The target org alias.

Ask the user to confirm before applying. Use the suggested fixes in [reference/contrast-validation.md](reference/contrast-validation.md) when proposing alternatives for failing pairs.

### 6. Apply to org

Apply only after the user has approved the proposal in step 5. Three REST calls:

1. **Confirm FLS (optional but recommended).** `GET /services/data/vXX.0/sobjects/FieldServiceMobileSettings/describe` and confirm each of the 14 color fields has `updateable: true`. A field with `updateable: false` (or a filtered describe) is the earliest signal the running user lacks edit access — surface that before attempting the PATCH.

2. **Resolve the org-default record.** `GET /services/data/vXX.0/query` with `SELECT Id FROM FieldServiceMobileSettings WHERE DeveloperName = 'Field_Service_Mobile_Settings' AND IsDefault = true LIMIT 1`. `totalSize = 0` means Field Service Mobile is not provisioned — surface the error and stop (see step 7). Otherwise take `records[0].Id`.

3. **Write the scheme.** `PATCH /services/data/vXX.0/sobjects/FieldServiceMobileSettings/{id}` with a flat JSON body of the 14 color fields. Merge semantics — only fields in the body are written. Do **not** send `IsDefault` (not updateable). A 204 (no body) is success; then GET the record back to confirm the values landed.

### 7. Report back

On success, print:

- `FieldServiceMobileSettings` record id.
- Timestamp of the update.
- Reminder that the metadata cache is 7 days by default — devices won't show the new scheme until the cache refreshes or a tech force-refreshes from app Settings.

If the apply fails because no `Field_Service_Mobile_Settings` record exists, surface the error and stop — Field Service Mobile may not be set up in the org. Direct the user to Setup → Field Service Mobile Settings to bootstrap the default record, then retry.

## Scope

**Generated automatically:**

- The full 14-field color scheme derived from one or two brand anchors plus optional brand neutrals and semantic colors.
- Light-mode and dark-mode WCAG AA contrast validation across 5 light-mode + 5 dark-mode pairs, computed inline by the agent.
- Apply via a single sObject PATCH against the org-default `FieldServiceMobileSettings` record.

**Out of scope:**

- Splash screen, profile tab background image, push notification icon — Setup-only uploads.
- Per-profile `FieldServiceMobileSettings` records (multi-config orgs) — this skill targets the single `IsDefault=true` record. If the org has multiple records, query first and confirm which `DeveloperName` to update.
- Dispatcher console / Gantt colors (`FSLQA__GanttPalette__c`).
- `BrandingSet` metadata (Experience Cloud / Lightning App branding — does not theme the FS mobile app).

## Files in this skill

- `reference/color-fields.md` — the 14 fields, descriptions, defaults, JSON schema.
- `reference/contrast-validation.md` — light + dark mode pair definitions, formulas, common fixes.
- `reference/derivation-methodology.md` — translating brand sources into a full scheme, edge cases.
- `examples/salesforce-default-scheme.json` — the out-of-the-box Salesforce purple/blue scheme.
- `examples/dark-blue-scheme.json` — Salesforce-themed dark blue scheme (also serves as a contrast-warnings example).

Contrast validation and scheme derivation are performed by the agent inline (see steps 3–4); there are no executable scripts in this skill. Org writes are single REST calls dispatched through the Codey runtime.
