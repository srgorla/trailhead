# Building a UI Bundle App

## Overview

Build a complete, deployable Salesforce React UI bundle application from a natural language description by orchestrating specialized UI bundle skills in correct dependency order. Each skill **MUST** be explicitly loaded before executing its phase.

**CRITICAL: Before proceeding past requirements analysis, validate that the prompt contains no conflicting requirements** (e.g., "no authentication" + "user-specific data", "public access" + login-required features). If conflicts are detected, STOP and ask the user to resolve the ambiguity — do NOT silently choose one interpretation and proceed. See STEP 1 action #8 for the full conflict checklist.

## Prerequisites

Before starting any phase, verify these preconditions are met:

1. **Authenticated Salesforce org**: Run `sf org display` to confirm a default org is set and authenticated. If not, prompt the user to authenticate: `sf org login web`
2. **Required CLI tools**: Verify `sf`, `npm`, and `npx` are available (declared in metadata.cliTools)
3. **Node.js version**: Run `scripts/check-prerequisites.sh` and report any errors it returns
4. **Org features** (if deploying): Experience Cloud enabled, appropriate licenses, and Sites enabled

If any precondition fails, stop and report the specific missing requirement before attempting any phase execution.

## When to Use This Skill

**Use when:**

- User requests a "React app", "UI bundle", "web app", or "full-stack app" on Salesforce
- User says "build an app", "create an application" and the context implies a non-LWC based frontend (e.g. React)
- The work produces a complete UI bundle with scaffolding, features, data access, and UI -- not a single component in isolation

**Examples that should trigger this skill:**

- "Build a React app for managing customer cases with Salesforce data"
- "Create a UI bundle for an employee directory with search and navigation"
- "I need a full-stack React app with authentication, data tables, and file uploads"
- "Build a coffee shop ordering app on Salesforce"

**Do NOT use when:**

- Creating a single page or component (use `experience-ui-bundle-frontend-generate`)
- Only installing a feature (use `experience-ui-bundle-features-generate`)
- Only setting up data access (use `experience-ui-bundle-salesforce-data-access`)
- Only deploying an existing app (use `experience-ui-bundle-deploy`)
- Building a Lightning Experience app with custom objects and metadata (use `platform-lightning-app-coordinate`)
- Troubleshooting or debugging an existing UI bundle

---

## Prompt Classification Keywords

This skill makes two decisions directly from the raw prompt text. Use these tables as the single
source for both — do not restate or re-derive the lists elsewhere in this file.

**1. Phase 2 (Features) is required if the prompt mentions ANY of:**

| Category | Keywords | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Data features | search, filter, sort, pagination, table, grid, list | |
| Navigation | navigation, nav, menu, routing | |
| Authentication | authentication, auth, login, logout, user session, user login | |
| Integrations | upload, file | |
| UI | shadcn, components, forms, buttons, cards | |
| Chat (Phase 5 only) | chat | Phase 5 only — unless combined with a Phase 2 keyword (e.g., "chat with authentication"), then Phase 2 runs first for auth prerequisites |

Negating one category (e.g. "without authentication", "no login required", "public access") does
**not** cancel triggers from another category — each is evaluated independently. Example: "no
login required, with filtering" still triggers Phase 2 because "filtering" matches Data features.
Skip Phase 2 only when the prompt matches none of the keywords above.

**2. Hosting target — extract from prompt keywords:**

| Hosting target | Keywords |
|-----------------|----------|
| Experience Site | "Experience Site", "Community", "external users", "public users", "guest users" |
| Custom Application | "Custom Application", "internal users", "Lightning app" |

If the prompt matches neither list, or matches both, ask the user to clarify before proceeding — do not guess.

## Dependency Graph & Build Order

### Phase 0: Template Offer & Bootstrap (Prerequisites)

```text
Offer prebuilt starter template (experience-ui-bundle-project-generate)
    v
If template chosen: scaffold via sf template generate project -- Phase 1 skipped
    v
If declined: run scripts/check-sfdx-project.sh
    v
If missing: create sfdx-project.json
    v
Verify project directory initialized
```

Offers a faster, less error-prone starting point before building from scratch. If no template is used, ensures an SFDX project exists before attempting to generate a UI bundle — without this, `sf template generate ui-bundle` will fail with a hard error. Always check first — do not assume the project structure exists.

**Action:** Load `experience-ui-bundle-project-generate` and offer the two starter templates. If declined, run `scripts/check-sfdx-project.sh` and report any errors it returns. If the script reports an error, create the missing `sfdx-project.json` before proceeding.

### Phase 1: Scaffolding (Foundation)

```text
Determine hosting target (Experience Site / Custom Application)
    v
UI Bundle scaffold (sf template generate ui-bundle --template reactbasic)
    v
Install dependencies (npm install)
    v
Bundle metadata (uibundle-meta.xml with <target>, ui-bundle.json)
    v
CSP Trusted Sites (if external domains needed)
```

Creates the UI bundle directory structure, meta XML (including hosting target), and optional routing/headers config. **CRITICAL**: Hosting target must be determined FIRST because the metadata skill requires `<target>` in Phase 1. All subsequent phases require the scaffold to exist.

**Prune unused scaffold when the prompt is constraining.** The `reactbasic` template ships a full shadcn component set, GraphQL tooling (`codegen.yml`, `.graphqlrc.yml`, `src/api/graphqlClient.ts`, `graphql:*` npm scripts), and test infra (`playwright.config.ts`, `vitest.config.ts`, `vitest.setup.ts`) regardless of what the prompt asked for. If the prompt explicitly limits scope (e.g. "skip any features or integrations", "just scaffold and build X", "no need to install dependencies") and Phase 2 and/or Phase 3 are consequently skipped, remove the scaffold pieces those phases would have owned before Phase 4 runs:

- **Phase 2 skipped** → delete shadcn components under `src/components/ui/` except the ones Phase 4's pages actually import; remove unused example/demo components.
- **Phase 3 skipped** → delete `codegen.yml`, `.graphqlrc.yml`, `src/api/graphqlClient.ts`, `graphql:schema`/`graphql:codegen` scripts from `package.json`, and any `hooks/` data-fetching stubs (e.g. `useAsyncData.ts`) the template pre-seeded.
- **Neither testing nor deployment requested** → leave `playwright.config.ts`/`vitest.*` only if the prompt implies testing; otherwise remove them too.
- Rewrite `README.md` to describe the actual app built, not the generic template boilerplate — or delete it if the prompt says to do minimal work only.

**Deleting a file is only half the job — every reference to it must be removed in the same pass, or you trade over-generation for broken cross-file consistency (worse: a dangling import is a functional break, not just scope creep).** Concretely, after deleting any of the above:

- `vite.config.ts` — remove the `vite-plugin-graphql-codegen` import and its `codegen({ configFilePathOverride: ... })` plugin block if `codegen.yml` was deleted; remove the `test:` config block (`setupFiles`, `coverage`, etc.) if `vitest.*` was deleted.
- `package.json` — remove now-unused dependencies (`vite-plugin-graphql-codegen`, `@graphql-codegen/*`, `playwright`, `vitest`, etc.) and their npm scripts, not just the config files.
- Any component/page that imports a deleted hook, client, or shadcn component (e.g. `useAsyncData`, `graphqlClient`) must have that import and its usage removed or replaced — never leave an import pointing at a file that no longer exists.
- Do NOT re-add a file you just deleted elsewhere in the same pass (e.g. deleting `codegen.yml` while still emitting `.graphqlrc.yml`) — decide scope once per concern and apply it consistently across every file that touches that concern.
- Before finishing Phase 4, run `scripts/check-dangling-refs.sh <deleted-basename>` for each deleted file and report any errors it returns.

### Phase 2: Features (Required if prompt mentions feature keywords — see "Prompt Classification Keywords" above)

```text
Search project code (src/) for existing implementations
    v
Install dependencies (npm install)
    v
Search, describe, and install features (auth, shadcn, search, navigation, GraphQL)
    v
Resolve conflicts (two-pass: --on-conflict error, then --conflict-resolution)
    v
Integrate __examples__ files into target files (verify build succeeds), then delete them
```

Installs pre-built, tested feature packages. See "Prompt Classification Keywords" above for the full trigger keyword list and negative-phrasing handling — these features provide the foundation that UI components build on top of.

Only skip this phase if the app is truly a minimal "hello world" with no interactive features (no trigger keywords present at all).

### Phase 2.5: Custom Objects (Required if the prompt requires a new custom Salesforce object the org doesn't have)

See `references/phase-custom-objects.md` for Phase 2.5 (Custom Objects) details.

### Phase 3: Data Access (Backend Wiring)

```text
Ground every entity/field against the org (per experience-ui-bundle-salesforce-data-access)
    v
Generate queries/mutations FROM the verified names (never from guessed fields)
    v
Generate types (npm run graphql:codegen) and wire into components
    v
Validate and test (npx eslint, ask user before testing mutations)
```

Sets up the data layer using the **`@salesforce/platform-sdk`** Data SDK (`createDataSDK().graphql`).
GraphQL is preferred for record operations; REST for Connect, Apex, or UI API endpoints. **The
`experience-ui-bundle-salesforce-data-access` skill owns the grounding + authoring workflow — load it and follow
it; do not substitute a local-schema grep or guessed field names.** Grounding happens against the
**live org**, so it does not require a local `schema.graphql` to be present. If Phase 2.5 created a
new object, it must be deployed before this phase's grounding step can find it.

### Phase 4: UI (Frontend)

```text
Layout, navigation, header, and footer (appLayout.tsx)
    v
Pages (routed views)
    v
Components (widgets, forms, tables)
```

Builds the React UI. References the data layer from Phase 3 and the features from Phase 2. Must replace all boilerplate and placeholder content.

### Phase 5: Integrations (Optional)

```text
Agentforce chat widget (if requested)
File upload API (if requested)
```

These are independent and can be executed in parallel if both are needed.

### Phase 6: Deployment

```text
Org authentication
    v
Pre-deploy UI bundle build (npm install + npm run build)
    v
Deploy metadata
    v
Post-deploy configuration (permissions, profiles, named credentials, connected apps, custom settings, flow activation)
    v
Import data (if data plan exists)
    v
Fetch GraphQL schema and run codegen
*(Re-fetches schema from the deployed org -- required because the remote schema may differ from the local one used in Phase 3. Guard against an empty or stale result -- Salesforce Edge caching can briefly serve the pre-deploy schema; re-fetch/retry before trusting it as empty and before running codegen)*
    v
Final UI bundle build (rebuilds with the deployed schema)
```

Follows the canonical 7-step deployment sequence. Must deploy metadata before fetching schema. Must assign permissions before schema fetch.

### Phase 7: Hosting Target Infrastructure

Deploy the hosting target infrastructure determined in Phase 1. Choose **one** of the following based on the app's audience:

#### Phase 7a: Experience Site (External)

```text
Resolve site properties (siteName, appDevName, etc.)
    v
Generate site metadata (Network, CustomSite, DigitalExperience)
    v
Deploy site infrastructure
```

Creates the Digital Experience site that hosts the UI bundle. Use when the user wants a public-facing or authenticated site URL for external users. **Note**: The `<target>ExperienceSite</target>` was already set in meta XML during Phase 1.

#### Phase 7b: Custom Application (Internal)

```text
Resolve app properties (appName, appNamespace, appLabel)
    v
Generate CustomApplication metadata (applications/*.app-meta.xml)
    v
Deploy custom application
```

Creates a Custom Application entry in the Lightning App Launcher. Use when the app is for internal users accessing it within Lightning Experience. **Note**: The `<target>CustomApplication</target>` was already set in meta XML during Phase 1.

## Execution Workflow

### STEP 0: Offer a Prebuilt Template (before scaffolding from scratch)

**Before** analyzing requirements or scaffolding, check whether a prebuilt starter template fits —
it is faster and less error-prone than building from scratch.

- **Load skill: Invoke `experience-ui-bundle-project-generate`.** It offers two minimal React starter
  projects (internal / employee-facing and external / customer-facing) and, if the user picks one,
  generates it into the project directory with `sf template generate project`.
- **If the user chooses a template:** the scaffolding phase (Phase 1) is effectively done. Skip
  straight to populating/customizing the project — continue at the phase that matches what they
  want to change (typically Phase 4 UI, or Phase 3 data access), then Phase 6 deployment.
- **If the user declines** (wants to start from scratch, or none fit): proceed normally to STEP 1.

Do not skip this step silently — always offer the choice at the start of a from-scratch app build.

### STEP 1: Requirements Analysis & Planning

**Actions:**

1. Parse the user's natural language request
2. Identify the app name and purpose
3. Extract pages and navigation structure
4. Identify data entities and Salesforce objects needed
5. Detect feature requirements (authentication, search, file upload, chat)
6. Determine hosting target (Experience Site OR Custom Application) — see "Prompt Classification Keywords" above; if ambiguous, ask user to clarify before proceeding
7. Identify external domains for CSP registration
8. **Check for conflicting requirements** — STOP and ask user if any of the following conflicts are detected:
   - "No authentication" OR "public/guest access" AND "user-specific data" OR "show current user's data" OR "My [Entity]" view
   - "External users" AND "Custom Application" (Custom Apps are internal-only)
   - "Public access" AND features requiring login (file upload, user profile, personalization)

> **The plan MUST contain an explicit grounding step before any query authoring.** Do not list
> guessed object/field names as settled facts and defer verification to codegen. The data-access
> portion of the plan must read: "verify these entities/fields against the org (via
> `experience-ui-bundle-salesforce-data-access`), then author queries from the verified names." A plan that
> authors queries first and codegens later is the failure mode that produces guessed fields and
> hand-stubbed types — do not emit it.

**Before proceeding to Output (Build Plan), validate:**

- [ ] **No conflicting requirements detected** — if conflicts exist (see action #8 above), STOP and report:
  ```text
  ERROR: Conflicting requirements detected:
  - [describe the specific conflict, e.g., "The prompt requires 'no authentication' while also requiring a 'My Cases' view scoped to the current user's identity"]
  
  RESOLUTION NEEDED: Please clarify:
  - [specific question, e.g., "Should the app require login (removing the 'no authentication' requirement), or should all data be public (removing the user-scoped view)?"]
  ```
  **Do NOT proceed to build plan generation or any phase execution until this conflict is resolved.**

**Output: Build Plan**

```text
UI Bundle App Build Plan: [App Name]

SCAFFOLDING:
- App name: [PascalCase name]
- Hosting target: [Experience Site / Custom Application] **REQUIRED**
- Routing: [SPA rewrites, trailing slash config]
- External domains: [domains needing CSP registration]

FEATURES:
- [list of features to install: auth, shadcn, search, navigation, etc.]

CUSTOM OBJECTS (if applicable):
- New objects/fields: [list any object the org does not already have, with its fields -- delegate to platform-custom-object-generate, not authored here]

DATA ACCESS:
- Objects: [Salesforce objects to query/mutate]
- Grounding: [verify each object + its fields against the org via experience-ui-bundle-salesforce-data-access BEFORE authoring — list the objects/fields to confirm, not assumed-correct names]
- Queries: [GraphQL queries to author FROM the verified names]
- REST endpoints: [only where GraphQL/uiapi genuinely cannot cover it — not as a fallback for fields that were hard to verify]

UI:
- Layout: [description of app shell/navigation]
- Pages: [list of pages with routes]
- Components: [key components per page]
- Design direction: [aesthetic/style intent]

INTEGRATIONS (if applicable):
- Agentforce chat: [yes/no, agent ID if known]
- File upload: [yes/no, record linking pattern]

DEPLOYMENT:
- Target org: [org alias if known]

SKILL LOAD ORDER:
0. experience-ui-bundle-project-generate (offer a prebuilt template first; if chosen, Phase 1 scaffolding is skipped; if declined, run the Bootstrap check for an existing SFDX project -- no skill load required)
1. experience-ui-bundle-metadata-generate (determines hosting target FIRST)
2. experience-ui-bundle-features-generate (if features needed)
2.5. platform-custom-object-generate (if the prompt requires a new custom Salesforce object the org doesn't have -- MUST complete and deploy before step 3)
3. experience-ui-bundle-salesforce-data-access (if data access needed)
4. experience-ui-bundle-frontend-generate
5a. experience-ui-bundle-agentforce-client-generate (if chat requested)
5b. experience-ui-bundle-file-upload-generate (if file upload requested)
6. experience-ui-bundle-deploy
7a. experience-ui-bundle-site-generate (if Experience Site requested -- external users)
7b. experience-ui-bundle-custom-app-generate (if Custom Application requested -- internal users)
```

### STEP 2: Per-Phase Execution

Execute each phase sequentially following the standard pattern in `references/phase-execution-pattern.md`. **CRITICAL: Always load the skill before executing.** Skipping or reordering phases produces broken apps.

---

**Phase 0 -- Template Offer & Bootstrap**
- Load `experience-ui-bundle-project-generate`, offer templates. If chosen: skip Phase 1, continue at Phase 4. If declined: run `scripts/check-sfdx-project.sh`, create project if missing.

**Phase 1 -- Scaffolding** (skip if template used in Phase 0)
- **Precondition**: `scripts/check-sfdx-project.sh` passes
- Load `experience-ui-bundle-metadata-generate`. Determine hosting target FIRST. Run `sf template generate ui-bundle --template reactbasic`, configure meta XML with `<target>`.
- **Post-verification**: `scripts/check-phase-1-complete.sh` passes

**Phase 2 -- Features** (skip if no feature keywords present — see "Prompt Classification Keywords")
- Load `experience-ui-bundle-features-generate`. Install features, integrate examples. Verify with `npm run build`.

**Phase 2.5 -- Custom Objects** (skip if org has all needed objects)
- Read `references/phase-custom-objects.md` and follow execution steps.

**Phase 3 -- Data Access** (skip if no Salesforce data)
- Load `experience-ui-bundle-salesforce-data-access`. Fetch schema, ground entities, generate queries/mutations. Verify with `npx eslint`.

**Phase 4 -- UI** (ALWAYS REQUIRED)
- **Precondition**: `scripts/check-phase-1-complete.sh` passes
- Load `experience-ui-bundle-frontend-generate`. Build layout, pages, components. Replace all boilerplate.
- **Post-verification**: `scripts/check-phase-4-complete.sh` passes
- **CRITICAL**: Phase 4 generates the actual React UI. Never skip.

**Phase 5 -- Integrations** (skip if not requested)
- Load `experience-ui-bundle-agentforce-client-generate` (5a) and/or `experience-ui-bundle-file-upload-generate` (5b) as needed.

**Phase 6 -- Deployment**
- **Precondition**: `scripts/check-phase-6-ready.sh` passes
- Load `experience-ui-bundle-deploy`. Follow 7-step sequence. Prefer `scripts/org-setup.mjs` if available.
- **CRITICAL**: Guard against empty schema — retry fetch 3x before codegen.

**Phase 7a -- Experience Site** (external users)
- **Trigger**: `scripts/check-hosting-target.sh` outputs "ExperienceSite"
- Load `experience-ui-bundle-site-generate`. Deploy site infrastructure.

**Phase 7b -- Custom Application** (internal users)
- **Trigger**: `scripts/check-hosting-target.sh` outputs "CustomApplication"
- Load `experience-ui-bundle-custom-app-generate`. Deploy app metadata.

### STEP 2.5: Phase Completion Validation

Before proceeding to STEP 3 (Final Summary), validate that all required phases were executed. See `references/phase-completion-validation.md` for the full critical/warning checklist and exact error/warning text to report.

### STEP 3: Final Summary

After all phases complete, present a build summary:

```text
UI Bundle App Build Complete: [App Name]

PHASES COMPLETED:
[x] Phase 0: Template Offer & Bootstrap -- [template used: <name> / declined; SFDX project verified/created]
[x] Phase 1: Scaffolding -- [app name] UI bundle created with hosting target [Experience Site / Custom Application]
[x] Phase 2: Features -- [list of features installed, or "skipped"]
[x] Phase 2.5: Custom Objects -- [list of objects/fields created and deployed, or "skipped -- no new schema needed"]
[x] Phase 3: Data Access -- [list of entities wired up]
[x] Phase 4: UI -- [count] pages, [count] components
[x] Phase 5: Integrations -- [list or "none"]
[x] Phase 6: Deployment -- deployed to [org]
[x] Phase 7: Hosting Target -- [Experience Site URL / Custom Application name] **(never "skipped" -- Phase 1 requires a target, so exactly one of 7a/7b always runs)**

FILES GENERATED:
[list key files and their paths]

NEXT STEPS:
[any manual steps the user should take]
```

---

## Validation

Before presenting the build as complete, verify:

- [ ] **Scaffold exists**: UI bundle directory with valid meta XML and ui-bundle.json
- [ ] **Hosting target resolved and deployed**: Meta XML contains `<target>ExperienceSite</target>` or `<target>CustomApplication</target>` (never left unset), and the matching Phase 7a or 7b infrastructure was generated and deployed -- not skipped
- [ ] **Dependencies installed**: `node_modules/` exists and `package.json` has expected packages
- [ ] **Build passes**: `npm run build` produces `dist/` with no errors
- [ ] **Dist content exists**: `dist/` contains index.html, JS/CSS bundles, and assets (not just an empty directory)
- [ ] **Lint passes**: `npx eslint src/` reports 0 errors
- [ ] **No boilerplate**: All placeholder text, default titles, and template content has been replaced
- [ ] **Navigation works**: `appLayout.tsx` has real nav items matching created pages
- [ ] **Data layer wired**: Components use the `@salesforce/platform-sdk` Data SDK (`createDataSDK().graphql`), with all entities/fields grounded against the org — not guessed (if data access phase was executed)
- [ ] **CSP registered**: All external domains have CSP Trusted Site metadata (if applicable)

---

## Error Handling

### Category 1: Stop and Ask User

- App purpose is too vague to determine pages or data needs
- User wants features that conflict (e.g., "no authentication" + "show user-specific data")
- Hosting target cannot be determined (ask: "Is this for internal users (Custom Application) or external users (Experience Site)?")
- Target org is unknown and deployment is requested

### Category 2: Log Warning, Continue

- A feature install has minor conflicts (resolve and continue)
- Optional integration setup encounters non-blocking issues
- Build has non-error warnings

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Follow Phase Order

Never build UI before installing features. Never deploy before building. Dependencies are strict.

### 2. Replace All Boilerplate

Every generated app must feel purpose-built. Replace "React App" titles, "Vite + React" placeholders, and all default content with real app-specific text and branding.

### 3. Design with Intent

Follow the design thinking and frontend aesthetics guidance from `experience-ui-bundle-frontend-generate`. Every app should have a clear visual direction -- not generic defaults.
