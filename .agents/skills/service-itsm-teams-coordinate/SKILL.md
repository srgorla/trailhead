# Microsoft Teams for ITSM — End-to-End Setup Autopilot

Drive the **complete** Microsoft Teams for Employee Service (ITSM) setup as one continuous flow.
Delegate each stage to its specialized child skill, but own the **sequence** yourself and keep
going through every stage **without stopping to ask permission between stages**. Halt only at the
points where a human genuinely must act — nowhere else.

## Goal

Take the user from nothing to a working Teams ITSM integration (IT Desk + IT Service, Swarming, and
— if they want it — the embedded Agentforce agent) in a single guided run. The child skills carry
the verified API detail; this skill is the conductor that runs them in order and manages the handoffs.

## Core operating rule — run continuously, halt only where required

**Do everything with no midway stop unless the user must supply something or perform an off-platform
action.** Do **not** re-present a menu between stages, do **not** ask "shall I continue?" after each
stage, and do **not** ask the user to click Setup toggles this skill's children can do via API. Move
straight from one stage to the next, reporting progress as you go.

There are exactly **three mandatory halts** and **one branch** in the whole flow:

- **HALT 1 — Azure/Entra app** (Stage 2): you give the user the app-registration instructions and
  **wait** for them to register the app and provide the credentials. No Salesforce API can do this.
  The **Client ID** and **Tenant ID** are non-secret identifiers and may be given in chat; the
  **Client Secret is a confidential credential — NEVER ask for it in the conversation.** The agent
  gives the user one exact copy-paste command that writes the secret to a gitignored secret file
  (`! umask 077; printf '%s' 'PASTE-SECRET' > <secret-file> && echo written`) and reads it from that
  file. Keep the leading `!` — it runs the line in this session's Bash so the file persists. The agent
  never prints, echoes, or logs the value.
- **HALT 2 — IT Desk app install** (Stage 3): you give the Microsoft Marketplace link and **wait**
  for the user to reply **"installed"**. No API installs a Teams app into a tenant catalog.
- **HALT 3 — IT Service app install** (Stage 4): same as HALT 2, for the IT Service app.
- **BRANCH — IT Service Agentforce agent** (Stage 7): the IT Desk agent works automatically, but the
  IT Service embedded agent is pending work; **ask the user whether to do it**, and only run Stage 8
  if they say yes.

If the user goes silent at a halt, stop and wait — do not fabricate the value or skip ahead. Every
other transition is automatic.

> **Within each stage, execute one operation at a time.** The child skills make real, state-changing
> API calls; run a single operation, confirm it succeeded, then proceed — never batch state-changing
> calls into one parallel block. "No midway stop" means no *permission gate* between stages, not
> firing writes in parallel.

## The flow (run in this order)

### Stage 1 — Enable the Teams for Employee Service Go feature
Invoke **`service-itsm-teams-configure`** for the feature-enable half only (its Steps 1–3): enable
`service-cloud-itsm-teams-integration` and confirm `ITSMTeamsEnabled` reads `true`. Report progress,
then continue straight into Stage 2 — do **not** stop here.

### Stage 2 — Microsoft Entra app + Named Credentials  ⟶ HALT 1
Still within **`service-itsm-teams-configure`** (its Step 4a): give the user the exact Azure/Entra
app-registration clicks **including the Microsoft Graph permissions** it lists, and
**HALT** until they provide the credentials. The **Client ID** and **Tenant ID** are non-secret
identifiers — accept them in chat. The **Client Secret is confidential: never request it in the
conversation.** Give the user one exact copy-paste command that writes it to a gitignored secret file
(`! umask 077; printf '%s' 'PASTE-SECRET' > <secret-file> && echo written`) and read it from that
file. Keep the leading `!` — it runs the line in this session's Bash so the file persists. Never
print or echo it. The moment the identifiers are given and the secret is in the file:
- Write those values into the `MSTeamsSetupClientCredentialsEC` Named Credential **and** the
  `microsoft_auth_provider` Auth Provider **yourself, via API — nothing manual** (the child skill's
  Step 5 and its azure-credential-population reference carry the exact API bodies). Read the
  secret from the file at call time — do not inline the raw value into any logged text.
- Give the user the static **Grant Admin Consent** link and register the preferred site (child Step 5).
Then continue to Stage 3 automatically.

### Stage 3 — Set up IT Desk (fulfiller side)  ⟶ HALT 2
Invoke **`service-itsm-teams-itdesk-configure`**. Drive its whole checklist:
- Turn on the `OrgHasITSMFulfillerTeams` org preference (via API).
- **Manage User Access** — assign the fulfiller permission sets to the confirmed user(s):
  `TeamsForITSrvcsUser` + `MicrosoftGraphAccess`, **plus the API Enabled login permission set**
  (commonly `Teams_Employee_ApiAccess`) — required for login, not optional.
- **Turn on Swarming** — this stage includes `service-itsm-swarming-configure`
  (enables `service-cloud-swarming` and sets `SWARM_COLLABORATION_TOOL = "Teams"`).
- Give the **IT Desk Microsoft Marketplace link** + help doc, tell the user **the Azure account
  email must match the Salesforce user's email/Username** (SSO resolves MS UPN → `Username`), and
  **HALT** until the user replies **"installed."** Then continue to Stage 4.

### Stage 4 — Set up IT Service (employee side)  ⟶ HALT 3
Invoke **`service-itsm-teams-itservice-configure`**. Drive its whole checklist:
- Turn on the `OrgHasEmployeeServiceTeams` org preference (via API).
- **Manage User Access** — assign the employee permission set to the confirmed UEL user(s):
  `TeamsForEmployeeUser` (the dialog assigns only this one — **not** `MicrosoftGraphAccess`), **plus
  the API Enabled login permission set** the child's login prerequisites require.
- **Select the Digital Experience Site** (`SLACK_PREFERRED_SITE`) via API.
- Give the **IT Service Microsoft Marketplace link** + help doc, repeat the **email-must-match** note,
  and **HALT** until the user replies **"installed."** Then continue to Stage 5.

### Stage 5 — Ask the user to verify login
Ask the user to open the **IT Desk app** in Teams and sign in with the **fulfiller** credentials, and
the **IT Service app** with the **UEL/employee** credentials, and confirm both load. If either fails,
route to **`service-itsm-teams-debug`** for the pass/fail login diagnostic before proceeding.

### Stage 6 — Tell the user the IT Desk "Ask Agentforce" agent works automatically
Once IT Desk login is confirmed, tell the user that IT Desk's **Ask Agentforce** works automatically —
no further setup is needed on the fulfiller side.

### Stage 7 — Offer the IT Service Agentforce agent  ⟶ BRANCH
Tell the user the **IT Service** side has pending work: the embedded Agentforce agent ("Ask AI Agent")
does **not** reply until its messaging channel + Key Set + Embedded Service Deployment are built.
**Ask whether they want to set it up now** (use `AskUserQuestion`). If **no**, go to the completion
summary. If **yes**, run Stage 8.

### Stage 8 — Build the IT Service embedded agent (only if the user said yes)
Invoke **`service-itsm-teams-employee-agent-configure`**. It builds — 100% via API — the Web
messaging channel with **User Verification ON + a `JWKS_URL` Key Set**, the `Teams_AgentForce`
Embedded Service Deployment (publish), the routing flow, and the Agent Access permission set on the
portal user. Then tell the user to **retest from a brand-new Teams chat** to confirm the agent replies.

## After each stage

- **Report the child's ACTUAL verdict — never assume "Done."** A stage is complete only when its
  child skill explicitly reported success. If a child reports **blocked** (most commonly Stage 2 while
  the Entra app is unregistered, or a halt awaiting "installed"), keep that stage **`Blocked`/waiting**
  and hold at the halt — do not mark it done and do not skip ahead.
- Do not re-present a menu. State what just finished and what you're doing next, then do it.
- **Keep the report tight — summarize, don't transcribe.** Report each stage as a one-line status in
  the stage-progress table plus at most a short sentence of context; do **not** paste the child skill's
  API request/response bodies, tool-call logs, or step-by-step internals into the report — that detail
  lives in the child skill, and re-narrating it here is the single biggest source of a bloated,
  low-signal report. The reader needs *what happened and what's next*, not a replay of every call.

## Completion summary

When the flow ends (Stage 7 "no", or Stage 8 done, or a hard block the user chose not to resolve),
summarize each stage's real status. Header: all stages complete → **Complete**; any stage still
blocked/waiting → **Incomplete (action required)** with the exact next step; otherwise **Finished**.

## Rules

- ALWAYS show "(via service-itsm-teams-coordinate)" in the setup header.
- Run the stages **continuously**; the only interactive stops are HALT 1–3 and the Stage 7 branch.
- NEVER ask the user to click a Setup toggle a child skill can flip via API (feature enable, org
  prefs, permission-set assignment, digital site, named credentials).
- NEVER fabricate a halt value (Azure creds, "installed") or a child's success — wait for the real reply.
- Delegate every stage to its child skill; never re-implement a child's API logic inline here.
- Track progress across the conversation — do not re-run a completed stage.
- Do not show Salesforce record IDs in any output — human-readable names only.
- At Stages 3 and 4, always include the **Azure-email-must-match-Salesforce-email** note with the
  marketplace link, since a mismatch is a common silent login failure.

## Verification checklist

Before emitting any progress message or summary, confirm:

- [ ] The header line ends with `(via service-itsm-teams-coordinate)`.
- [ ] The flow is running continuously — no permission gate was inserted between stages beyond the
      three defined halts and the Stage 7 branch.
- [ ] Each stage's status reflects the child's actual verdict (`In progress`, `Blocked`/waiting, or
      `Done`) — not a hard-coded default.
- [ ] A stage waiting on a halt (Azure creds, "installed") is shown as waiting, never `Done`.
- [ ] Stages 3 and 4 each surfaced the marketplace link **and** the email-must-match note.
- [ ] The Stage 7 branch was offered as a yes/no question, and Stage 8 ran only on an explicit "yes."
- [ ] The next action delegates to a child skill; features are never configured inline here.
- [ ] No Salesforce record IDs appear in the output — human-readable names only.
