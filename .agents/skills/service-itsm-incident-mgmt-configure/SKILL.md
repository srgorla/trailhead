# Configuring ITSM Incident Management (master toggle)

Read and toggle the **master Incident Management** setting on a Salesforce ITSM org. This is the org-level switch that turns Incident Management on or off. Enabling it also brings up its sub-features on the server side, so a full enablement is a single operation on the master.

Writes are **idempotent** (skipped when the current status already matches the requested state), the skill always **reads before it writes**, and an explicit **confirm-to-write** checkpoint is required before any mutation.

## What this skill controls

| Preference (Setup UI label) | In scope |
|-----------------------------|----------|
| Incident Management enablement (master) | Yes — read and toggle |
| Default Field Validations for Incidents, Auto Closure of Child Incidents, Email-to-Incident sub-toggles, Incident Priority Matrix, Problem/Change/Case Management, ITSM External Client App setup | No |

For the exact URLs, wire shapes, and worked examples for the master read and write, see `references/mcp-invocation.md`.

## Scope

- **In scope**: read and toggle the master Incident Management preference.
- **Out of scope**: Default Field Validations for Incidents (`IncidentValidationsEnabled`); Incident Priority Matrix configuration; Auto Closure of Child Incidents and Email-to-Incident sub-toggles; Problem Management; Change Management; Case Management; ITSM External Client App setup; other ITSM prefs (`IncidentTriageAgentEnabled`, `IncAssignWithAgentEnabled`, `AssignedGroupValidationEnabled`); broadcast-channel prefs; creation or configuration of Incident, Problem, or ChangeRequest records.

---

## Preconditions

Before the skill can call anything on `headless-360`, the target org and MCP client must be configured. If any of these are unmet, the tools will surface as `401`, `403`, or `404` on the first call; **do not fabricate state — surface the raw error and stop**.

1. **Server activated on the org**: Setup → MCP Servers → `headless-360` → **Activate**. Activation can take up to ~2 minutes.
2. **External Client App wired**: an ECA in the org with OAuth scopes `mcp_api` and `refresh_token`, JWT-based access tokens enabled, PKCE required. ECA propagation can take up to 30 minutes.
3. **API v67.0+**: required for the read and write routes this skill uses.
4. **MCP client registration**: the client (adk-eval / Claude Code) has an `additionalServers.headless-360` entry pointing to the correct env URL (see `references/mcp-invocation.md`).

If any precondition fails, the tools return one of:
- `401 Unauthorized` → ECA not propagated, wrong scopes, or expired token.
- `403 Forbidden` → user lacks perm, or org missing `IncidentMgmt.orgHasITSMOrgPermission`.
- `404 Not Found` → server not activated on the org.

Report the raw response verbatim rather than guessing which precondition failed.

## Architecture — How configuration works

| Step | What happens | Tool |
|------|--------------|------|
| Preflight | Confirm the target routes are reachable | `describe`, `dispatch_readonly` |
| Read schema | Fetch the request/response contract for the read and the write | `describe` |
| Read current state | Fetch the current status of the master preference | `dispatch_readonly` |
| Decide operation | View / enable / disable — inferred from the prompt | — |
| Confirm-to-write | Present `(status: current → requested)` and require explicit "yes" | — |
| Apply change | Enable or disable the master via the write route | `dispatch` |
| Verify | Re-read and compare against the requested state | `dispatch_readonly` |

**Idempotency**: after the Phase-3 read, if the current state already matches the requested state, skip Phase 5 and treat the operation as a no-op. `references/mcp-invocation.md` documents the exact status field and match rule.

**Read-only tool selection**: use `dispatch_readonly` for the read. Use `dispatch` for the write. The server refuses mutating operations through `dispatch_readonly`.

**Wire shape**: `dispatch` and `dispatch_readonly` both take `{"url": "/services/data/...", "method": "GET|POST|PATCH|...", "body"?: {...}, "query_params"?: {...}}`. See `references/mcp-invocation.md` for the exact request/response shapes; call `describe` at runtime to confirm.

## Clarifying Questions

Ask only what is not already in conversation context:

| Field | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Requested direction | Explicit `enable` / `disable` (or `on` / `off`) | REQUIRED — no defaults; ask if the user only said "toggle" without a direction |
| Confirm write | Explicit "yes" before any `dispatch` mutation | **REQUIRED** — see Phase 4 |

If the user says "toggle" without specifying a direction, ask for the direction before Phase 4. Do not infer it from the current state.

---

## Workflow

All steps run against the `headless-360` MCP server; the tool namespace is `mcp__headless-360__<tool-name>`.

### Phase 0 — Reuse what the session already knows

Each preflight read below carries a **skip-if-already-known** clause. Before calling any
read endpoint, check whether an earlier turn in this session already produced the same
fact from a successful tool response tied to the current org (a prior invocation of this
skill, a parent orchestrator's live read, or an earlier `dispatch_readonly` this run).
**An explicit user statement is NOT a substitute** for a live read of the master
preference — user assertions can be stale or mistaken, and this skill relies on the read
being the source of truth for the confirmation payload and the Phase-6 idempotency verify.
When the only source is a user statement, re-read.

- **`describe` of the master read/write routes** — if the request/response schemas were
  already fetched against the current org this session, skip Phase 1 and Phase 2 and
  reuse the cached schema. `describe` output is stable within a session.
- **Current master preference state** — if the master `IncidentMgmtEnabled` value for
  the current org was already read this session **via a successful `dispatch_readonly`
  response** (Phase 3 result from an earlier run of this skill, or a parent orchestrator
  that already asked us to check), skip Phase 3 and reuse the recorded "before" value.
  A user's verbal claim that the switch is on or off is **not** cache-eligible.

**When in doubt, re-check.** Skip only when the earlier fact is unambiguously in context
AND you have not switched orgs — the `headless-360` MCP session binds to one org via the
JWT, so an org change is only possible if the session was re-authed mid-conversation. If
the user hints at a different org, or you cannot tell which org the earlier fact came
from, re-run the read. Note: any `dispatch` write elsewhere in the session that could
have flipped the master (this skill's Phase 5, or an admin change via another tool) also
invalidates the cache — re-read. A wrong skip on a live org write is worse than a
duplicated read.

### Phase 1 — Preflight (`discover` / `describe`)

1. *(Skip if the operation schemas were already verified this session — see Phase 0.)*
   Call `describe` on the read/write routes (or `discover` with a query like `"ITSM incident management setup discovery"` if the operation IDs are unknown). Confirm the operations exist and their argument schemas match `references/mcp-invocation.md`.
2. If any tool call returns `401` / `403` / `404`, halt and surface the raw error — the org or client is not configured correctly (see Preconditions).

### Phase 2 — Load Schemas (`describe`)

3. *(Skip if the schema for each operation is already cached this session — see Phase 0.)*
   For each operation the invocation will use, call `describe` and cache the returned request/response schema. **Do not hard-code the argument shape from the reference doc** — read it from `describe`; the docs are a working expectation, the runtime contract is whatever `describe` returns.

### Phase 3 — Read Current State (`dispatch_readonly`)

4. *(Skip if the current master state for this org was already read this session AND no
   write has flipped it since — see Phase 0.)*
   Read the current state of the master preference using the read route documented in `references/mcp-invocation.md`. Record the value as the "before" state for the Phase-4 confirmation and the Phase-6 verify.

   For a view-only request, stop after Phase 3 and go to Phase 7 to report.

### Phase 4 — Decide Operation + Confirm-to-Write (REQUIRED for any write)

5. Decide the operation from the user's prompt (view / enable / disable). If the user said "toggle" without a direction, ask for the direction first.

6. **Present the target payload** via `AskUserQuestion` as `(Master Incident Management: <current> → <requested>)`. Require an explicit "yes" before proceeding. **Proceed to Phase 5 ONLY on explicit "yes".** On "no", stop and report the current state without writing.

### Phase 5 — Apply the Change (skip for view-only)

7. Apply the idempotency rule from `references/mcp-invocation.md`: if the current state already matches the requested state, skip Phase 5 and mark the operation as an idempotent no-op.

8. Otherwise, dispatch the write via `dispatch` using the enable or disable route documented in `references/mcp-invocation.md`. Enabling the master brings up the Incident Management sub-features on the server side — no separate calls are needed to turn them on. Disabling the master leaves those sub-features at their last-set values.

9. On error (`4xx`, `5xx`), record the raw response verbatim and stop.

### Phase 6 — Verify (`dispatch_readonly`)

10. Re-issue the Phase-3 read and compare against the requested state per the rule in `references/mcp-invocation.md`. If they differ, treat it as a failed write and report the raw server response verbatim.

### Phase 7 — Report

11. Present a before/after summary:
    - View: `Master Incident Management: <current-status>`.
    - Toggle: `Master Incident Management: <before> → <after>` with verdict `SUCCEEDED` / `ALREADY-<state>` / `FAILED`.
    - On Phase-6 mismatch: `write FAILED — server state differs from request. Server response: <verbatim>`.

## Rules / Constraints

| Constraint | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| All operations run through the four hosted `headless-360` tools | The hosted MCP is the required transport |
| Read the argument schema for each operation via `describe` before calling `dispatch` / `dispatch_readonly` | The runtime contract is what `describe` returns; do not hard-code |
| Use `dispatch_readonly` for the read; use `dispatch` for the write | The server refuses mutating operations through `dispatch_readonly` |
| Always set/expect API **v67.0** minimum | The read and write routes require v67+ |
| Read live state before writing | The Phase-3 fetch is the source of truth for the confirmation prompt, the idempotency check, and the Phase-6 verify |
| **REQUIRED confirm-to-write checkpoint** before any `dispatch` mutation | Toggling this pref mutates org state; user must approve the exact plan |
| Idempotent — skip `dispatch` when the current state already matches the requested state | Avoids no-op writes; see `references/mcp-invocation.md` for the exact match rule |
| Report exact error text from the MCP tool response | The server surfaces the underlying error message verbatim |
| On `401` / `403` / `404` in Phase 1, halt and surface the raw error | The failing precondition is diagnosable only from the raw response |
| Do not put an orgId or Core URL in the `dispatch` arguments | The server derives the target org from the JWT issuer on the request |

## Verification Checklist

Before reporting completion of any mutation, confirm each of the following. If any item is unchecked, do not report success — surface what is missing.

- [ ] Phase 1 preflight (`describe` / `discover`) returned the operation without a `401` / `403` / `404`; if any was returned, the raw error was surfaced and the run halted.
- [ ] Phase 3 read against the master preference returned a status and that value was recorded as the "before" state.
- [ ] Phase 4 confirm-to-write presented `(Master Incident Management: <current> → <requested>)` via `AskUserQuestion` and the user replied with an explicit "yes" — no write dispatched on any other response (silence, "maybe", "looks good", implicit approval).
- [ ] Idempotency: if the current state already matched the requested state, Phase 5 was skipped and the run was reported as an idempotent no-op — no `dispatch` write was issued.
- [ ] Phase 5 write used `dispatch` (not `dispatch_readonly`) with the wire shape from `references/mcp-invocation.md`; on any `4xx` / `5xx`, the raw response was surfaced and the run halted.
- [ ] Phase 6 verify re-issued the Phase-3 read and the post-write state matched the user-approved target; any diff was reported as `write FAILED — server state differs from request`.
- [ ] The final report gave a before/after for the master preference with verdict `SUCCEEDED` / `ALREADY-<state>` / `FAILED`.
