# Embed Messaging Widget on an Experience Cloud Site

Wires an existing Embedded Messaging (MIAW) deployment onto an Experience Cloud site by retrieving the site's bundle (LWR `DigitalExperienceBundle` or Aura `ExperienceBundle`), patching the home page JSON to place the `experience_messaging:embeddedMessaging` component, staging the bundle into the local project, deploying it, publishing the site, and verifying guest access.

The operation is idempotent: if the component is already present it is updated in place (its `id` is preserved), so re-running with different ESD coordinates cleanly updates.

## Scope

- **In scope**: Detecting LWR vs Aura bundle type; scaffolding missing LWR template routes required by the site template (e.g. `too-many-requests`); patching all `sfdc_cms__themeLayout/*/content.json` files to insert or update the Embedded Messaging component in the footer region (site-wide placement); staging the bundle into `force-app`; async deploy with polling; resolving the `Network.Name` and publishing the site; guest-URL smoke test; manual Experience Builder fallback with a deep link.
- **Out of scope**: Creating the `EmbeddedServiceConfig` (Embedded Service Deployment) itself — use `service-digital-engagement-deployment-configure`; creating the `MessagingChannel` — use `service-digital-engagement-channel-configure`; creating the Experience Cloud site itself — use `experience-lwr-site-generate`; generating a standalone JS snippet for a non-Experience website.

---

## Clarifying Questions

Before executing, ask the user if not already clear:

- **Site name?** The `DeveloperName` of the Experience Cloud site (the metadata folder name under `digitalExperiences/site/<siteName>/` or `experiences/<siteName>/`).
- **Deployment coordinates?** The `deploymentName` (Embedded Service Deployment `DeveloperName`), the `scrtUrl`, and the `siteEndpoint` (Experience site base URL). All three come from the published `EmbeddedServiceConfig` — obtain from `service-digital-engagement-deployment-configure` output if not provided.
- **Target org alias?** For the `sf` commands.
- **URL path prefix?** The site's `UrlPathPrefix` (needed to resolve `Network.Name` for publish and to hit the guest URL for verification).

---

## Required Inputs

Gather or infer before proceeding:

- **Site name** — `DeveloperName` of the site
- **Deployment name** — `DeveloperName` of the `EmbeddedServiceConfig`
- **scrtUrl** — SCRT2 endpoint URL from the deployment
- **siteEndpoint** — Base URL of the Experience site
- **Target org alias**
- **URL path prefix** — Site's public URL path segment (e.g. `esw-site`)

Defaults applied to the component's attributes when writing:

- `isExpSiteAuthMode`: `false`
- `hideChatButtonOnLoad`: `"Default"`
- `clientVersion`: `"WebV1"`

---

## Workflow

Steps are sequential. If any automated step fails, proceed to the manual fallback (Phase 6) and do not claim the widget is "live" until either the guest-URL smoke test returns `200` or the user confirms manual publish.

### Phase 1 — Detect Bundle Type

1. **Retrieve both candidate bundles** into `<retrieve-dir>`. The script only performs a deterministic path check, so the retrieve calls must run first:

   ```bash
   sf project retrieve start --metadata "DigitalExperienceBundle:site/<siteName>" \
     --target-org <org-alias> --target-metadata-dir <retrieve-dir>
   sf project retrieve start --metadata "ExperienceBundle:<siteName>" \
     --target-org <org-alias> --target-metadata-dir <retrieve-dir>
   ```

   Either call may return "no metadata found" — that is expected; the missing bundle simply means the site is the other type.

2. **Run `scripts/detect_bundle_type.sh <retrieve-dir> <siteName>`.** It emits exactly one token to stdout:

   - `LWR` → the LWR marker file exists (`digitalExperiences/site/<siteName>/sfdc_cms__view/home/content.json`). Go to Phase 2.
   - `AURA` → the Aura marker file exists (`experiences/<siteName>/views/homeGuestLayout.json`). Go to Phase 3.
   - `UNKNOWN` (exit code 1) → neither marker exists. Skip to the manual fallback in Phase 6.

Read `references/bundle_detection.md` for retrieval command shapes and troubleshooting.

### Phase 2 — Patch the LWR Bundle

3. **Scaffold any missing LWR template routes** (commonly `too-many-requests`) before patching — missing routes fail the deploy. Route+view scaffolding is owned by `experience-lwr-site-generate` (see its `configure-content-route.md`, `configure-content-view.md`, and `handle-component-and-region-ids.md`). Delegate to that skill for the actual scaffold; this skill only supplies the messaging-specific context (which route the deploy is complaining about, and confirmation that the scaffolded pair resolves that specific deploy error). See `references/lwr_route_scaffolding.md` for the delegation pointer.

4. **Patch all themeLayout files** by running:

   ```bash
   scripts/patch_lwr_bundle.sh \
     <retrieve-dir>/digitalExperiences/site/<siteName> \
     <deploymentName> <scrtUrl> <siteEndpoint>
   ```

   The script iterates every `sfdc_cms__themeLayout/*/content.json` file. For each, it locates the `footer` region at `.contentBody.component.children[]`, walks into the existing `community_layout:section` wrapper's inner slot region, and either updates the existing `experience_messaging:embeddedMessaging` component in place (preserving its `id`) or appends a fresh component node. Targeting the themeLayout footer makes the widget site-wide (floating overlay on every page), equivalent to the Aura themeFooter placement. See `references/lwr_patch.md` for the JSON shapes and how to verify.

5. Proceed to Phase 4.

### Phase 3 — Patch the Aura Bundle

6. **Patch the home guest layout** by running:

   ```bash
   scripts/patch_aura_bundle.sh \
     <retrieve-dir>/experiences/<siteName>/views/homeGuestLayout.json \
     <deploymentName> <scrtUrl> <siteEndpoint>
   ```

   The script iterates `.regions[]`, picks the first region whose `.components[]` is non-empty, recurses through any `forceCommunity:section` wrappers, and either updates the existing `.componentName == "experience_messaging:embeddedMessaging"` component in place (preserving `id`) or appends a fresh `forceCommunity:section` wrapper. Aura uses `componentName` / `componentAttributes` (not `definition` / `attributes`) and has no `dxpStyle`. See `references/aura_patch.md` for JSON shapes and verification steps.

7. Proceed to Phase 4.

### Phase 4 — Stage and Deploy

8. **Copy the modified bundle into the project's default package.** Use `cp -R` so unchanged files travel with the modified one:

   - LWR: `cp -R <retrieve-dir>/digitalExperiences force-app/main/default/`
   - Aura: `cp -R <retrieve-dir>/experiences force-app/main/default/` **and also copy** the sibling `<siteName>.site-meta.xml` file — Aura deploys are rejected without it.

9. **Async deploy and poll**:

    ```bash
    sf project deploy start --source-dir force-app/main/default \
      --target-org <org-alias> --async
    ```

    Poll every 15 seconds up to 10 minutes:

    ```bash
    sf project deploy report --job-id <job-id> --target-org <org-alias>
    ```

    Stop when status is `Succeeded`, `Failed`, `SucceededPartial`, or `Canceled`. On failure, surface the deploy report and do not proceed to publish. See `references/deploy_and_publish.md` for the full polling loop and common failure modes.

### Phase 5 — Publish and Verify

10. **Resolve the `Network.Name`.** `Network.Name` frequently differs from the site `DeveloperName`, so query it by the URL path prefix rather than guessing:

    ```bash
    sf data query --query \
      "SELECT Name FROM Network WHERE UrlPathPrefix='<urlPath>' LIMIT 1" \
      --target-org <org-alias>
    ```

11. **Publish the community** with the resolved name:

    ```bash
    sf community publish --name "<resolved-Name>" --target-org <org-alias>
    ```

12. **Smoke-test guest access** by hitting the public URL:

    ```bash
    curl -sL -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" \
      https://<domainHostname>/<urlPath>
    ```

    Report success only when the response is `200`.

### Phase 6 — Manual Fallback

13. If any automated step fails (bundle undetectable, patch write blocked, deploy fails, publish fails, or guest URL not `200`), print the Experience Builder deep link and verbatim instructions from `references/manual_fallback.md`. Do **not** claim the widget is live until the user confirms.

    The deep link is:

    ```text
    https://<MyDomain>.lightning.force.com/sfsites/picasso/core/config/commeditor.apexp?...networkId=<Network.Id>
    ```

    Resolve `<MyDomain>` via `sf org display --target-org <org-alias>` and `<Network.Id>` via:

    ```bash
    sf data query --query \
      "SELECT Id FROM Network WHERE UrlPathPrefix='<urlPath>' LIMIT 1" \
      --target-org <org-alias>
    ```

    **Do not hardcode either value.** Instruct the user to open Experience Builder, drag the Embedded Messaging component onto the target page, pick the deployment from the property panel, and click Publish.

## Rules / Constraints

| Constraint | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| Detect bundle type from retrieval output, do not assume | LWR and Aura sites need different files patched with different key names |
| Preserve the existing component `id` when updating in place | Ensures idempotency; the Experience runtime keys off `id` |
| Every new `id` must be a fresh UUID | Duplicate IDs corrupt the layout and can fail render |
| LWR uses `definition` / `attributes`; Aura uses `componentName` / `componentAttributes` | Wrong key names silently drop the component from render |
| LWR `community_layout:section` `sectionConfig` lives inside `.attributes` as a JSON string (not a top-level property, not a nested object) | Top-level placement violates the schema's `additionalProperties: false` constraint; the serializer also expects a string not an object |
| Aura sibling `<siteName>.site-meta.xml` must be copied alongside the bundle | Deploy is rejected without it |
| Poll the async deploy; do not fire-and-forget | Publish must run only after deploy succeeds |
| Resolve `Network.Name` from `UrlPathPrefix`, do not reuse site `DeveloperName` | The two are frequently different |
| Do not claim "live on the site" until the guest URL returns `200` or the user confirms | Publish is asynchronous; premature success reports mislead |
| Never hardcode `MyDomain` or `Network.Id` in the manual fallback link | Values are org-specific and must be queried |
| Idempotency: re-running with new ESD coordinates must update in place | Users iterate on `deploymentName`, `scrtUrl`, `siteEndpoint` during setup |

---

## Gotchas

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| `too-many-requests` route missing during LWR deploy | Scaffold the missing route+view pair per `references/lwr_route_scaffolding.md` |
| Aura deploy rejected with missing site metadata | Copy the sibling `<siteName>.site-meta.xml` from the retrieve dir |
| Component appended but not rendering | Confirm the region wrapper uses the correct `type: "region"` key and that Aura components use `componentName` (not `definition`) |
| `sf community publish` fails with "community not found" | The `Network.Name` differs from site `DeveloperName`; resolve via `UrlPathPrefix` query |
| Guest URL returns `403` or `503` after publish | Publish is async — retry the smoke test after 60s before falling back to manual |
| Re-run adds a second messaging component | The recursive search matched on the wrong key name; component detection must use `definition` (LWR) or `componentName` (Aura) |
| Deploy succeeds but widget does not appear on all pages | For LWR, confirm the component was injected into `sfdc_cms__themeLayout/*/content.json` footer (not `sfdc_cms__view/home/content.json` — that is page-specific). For Aura, confirm `homeGuestLayout.json` was patched (themeFooter region). |
| `sectionConfig` written as an object | Serialize it as a JSON string; the CMS parser will not accept an object |

## Verification Checklist

### Bundle Detection
- [ ] Was exactly one of `sfdc_cms__view/home/content.json` (LWR) or `views/homeGuestLayout.json` (Aura) found?
- [ ] If neither was found, did the workflow route to the manual fallback?

### Patch Correctness
- [ ] For LWR, are the messaging component's keys `definition` and `attributes`?
- [ ] For Aura, are the keys `componentName` and `componentAttributes`?
- [ ] When updating in place, was the existing `id` preserved?
- [ ] When appending, are all new `id` values fresh UUIDs?
- [ ] For LWR, did the script patch every `sfdc_cms__themeLayout/*/content.json` (not just `home/content.json`)?
- [ ] For LWR, does the messaging node appear inside the `footer` region's subtree in each themeLayout?
- [ ] For LWR, is `clientVersion` set to `"WebV2"` in the messaging node attributes?

### Deploy
- [ ] For Aura, was `<siteName>.site-meta.xml` copied alongside the bundle?
- [ ] Was the async deploy polled until a terminal status?
- [ ] Is the terminal status `Succeeded` or `SucceededPartial` before proceeding to publish?

### Publish
- [ ] Was `Network.Name` resolved via `UrlPathPrefix`, not reused from site `DeveloperName`?
- [ ] Did `sf community publish` complete without error?

### Verify
- [ ] Did the guest URL curl return `200`?
- [ ] Did the workflow refrain from claiming success until `200` was observed or the user confirmed manual publish?

---

## Output Expectations

Deliverables:

- Modified `sfdc_cms__themeLayout/*/content.json` files (one per themeLayout) in the retrieval directory and in `force-app/main/default/...` (LWR); or modified `homeGuestLayout.json` (Aura)
- (LWR only, if needed) new `sfdc_cms__route/<RouteApiName>/` + `sfdc_cms__view/<viewId>/` pair for any scaffolded missing route
- Deploy `job-id` and the final deploy report
- Publish confirmation
- Guest URL smoke-test HTTP status
- On failure: the Experience Builder deep link and manual instructions

Do not produce the `EmbeddedServiceConfig` or the `MessagingChannel` metadata — those are the responsibilities of the deployment and channel skills below.
