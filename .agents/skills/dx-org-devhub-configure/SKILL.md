# Enable Dev Hub & View Scratch Org Allocation

Enable **Dev Hub** on a Salesforce org, verify whether it is already on, and see
the org's **scratch org allocation** (Active and Daily limits and how many
remain) — for the default org or a named org. The skill can also configure Dev
Hub sub-preferences (packaging, org shape export, scratch org snapshots) and
list the active scratch orgs created from a Dev Hub.

Dev Hub is the org feature that lets you **create and manage scratch orgs** and
**second-generation (2GP) / unlocked packages**.

## When to use

Trigger on requests like:

- "Enable Dev Hub" / "Turn on Dev Hub" / "Set up this org for scratch orgs."
- "Is Dev Hub enabled on my org?" / "Check if Dev Hub is on."
- "How many scratch orgs can I create?" / "What's my scratch org allocation /
  limit?" / "How many scratch orgs do I have left?"
- "Turn on packaging / 2GP / unlocked packages" / "Enable org shape export" /
  "Enable scratch org snapshots" (Dev Hub sub-preferences).
- "List the scratch orgs on my Dev Hub."

## When NOT to use

Do **not** trigger this skill for:

- **Creating or deleting an individual scratch org** — that is
  `sf org create scratch` / `sf org delete scratch`, a different workflow. This
  skill enables the *Dev Hub feature* and reports *allocation*; it does not
  create scratch orgs.
- **Switching the default/active org** — use `dx-org-switch`.
- **Trial or org expiration dates** ("when does my org expire") — use
  `dx-org-trial-expiration-check`.

## How Dev Hub enablement is determined

The standard object **`ScratchOrgInfo`** is provisioned and becomes queryable
**only when Dev Hub is enabled**. So a successful `SELECT COUNT() FROM
ScratchOrgInfo` means Dev Hub is **ON**; an `INVALID_TYPE` error means it is
**OFF**. This is the reliable signal.

> Do **not** infer enablement from `sf org list limits` alone: it reports
> `ActiveScratchOrgs` / `DailyScratchOrgs` rows even on orgs where Dev Hub is
> **off**, so limits show allocation but not enablement.

## How enabling works (important)

- The Dev Hub master switch is the **deployable** Metadata API field
  **`DevHubSettings.enableScratchOrgManagementPref`**. There is **no**
  `enableDevHub` field and **no** dedicated `sf` command to turn it on —
  deploying this setting is exactly what the Setup toggle does.
- **Enabling is irreversible** — once on, Dev Hub cannot be turned off.
- **Requires** a user with **ModifyAllData** or **ModifyMetadata** (a **System
  Administrator** has these). A user without them gets `INSUFFICIENT_ACCESS`.
- **Cannot** be enabled in a **sandbox**, or in an org that has a **registered
  namespace**.
- Available in **Developer, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited**, and **trial**
  editions.

## Steps

1. **CRITICAL:** Run the bundled helper script, which handles Dev Hub detection,
   the enablement deploy (with a safe dry-run default), allocation math, and
   structured output, and works on macOS and Linux. Always invoke it by
   **absolute path** from the skill directory — never `./scripts/`, which
   resolves against the user's current directory and will either run the wrong
   script or fail. The script self-checks this: if `$0` is not absolute it exits
   with a usage error, so pass the full path to `<skill_dir>` (the directory
   containing this SKILL.md).

   ```bash
   bash "<skill_dir>/scripts/devhub.sh" <alias-or-username>            # status: on? + allocation
   bash "<skill_dir>/scripts/devhub.sh"                               # default org (target-org)
   bash "<skill_dir>/scripts/devhub.sh" <org> --allocation           # allocation only
   bash "<skill_dir>/scripts/devhub.sh" <org> --enable               # validate enabling (dry run)
   bash "<skill_dir>/scripts/devhub.sh" <org> --enable --apply       # actually enable (irreversible)
   bash "<skill_dir>/scripts/devhub.sh" <org> --list-scratch         # list active scratch orgs
   bash "<skill_dir>/scripts/devhub.sh" <alias> --instance-url <url> --enable --apply  # log in first, then enable
   bash "<skill_dir>/scripts/devhub.sh" <url>                        # bare instance URL: log in to it
   ```

   When the user supplies an instance URL (their My Domain, sandbox, or
   pre-release/scratch login URL — e.g.
   `https://my-domain.my.salesforce.com`), pass that exact URL with
   `--instance-url <url>` — the script accepts Salesforce-owned hostnames and logs in with
   `sf org login web --instance-url <url>` and then continues. A bare URL
   positional is accepted as shorthand for the same thing.

   `<skill_dir>` is the absolute path to the directory containing this SKILL.md.

2. **For enablement, default to a dry run first.** Run `--enable` (no `--apply`)
   to validate the deploy, then relay the result. Because enabling is
   **irreversible**, only run `--enable --apply` when the user has clearly asked
   to actually enable Dev Hub. Applied operations require an explicit org alias
   or username; the script refuses to mutate an implicit default org. If the
   deploy is rejected for permissions, surface the Setup-UI fallback it prints.

3. Relay the script output. When an org can't be queried, surface the
   `sf org login web` command the script prints so the user can authenticate.
   Pick optional flags based on the request (see below): `--allocation` for
   limits only, `--list-scratch` to enumerate scratch orgs, `--packaging` /
   `--snapshots` / `--shape` to turn on sub-preferences, `--json` for automation.

## Before you finish

Verify these before returning your answer:

- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Invoked the helper via its **absolute path** (`bash "<skill_dir>/scripts/devhub.sh" …`), never `./scripts/` (the script rejects a non-absolute `$0`).
- [ ] Did **not** run `--apply` unless the user clearly asked to actually enable Dev Hub or deploy a preference — enabling is **irreversible**.
- [ ] Relayed the script's own output (status/allocation or the login/Setup-UI guidance it printed), rather than substituting a hand-written answer.

## Options

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `--allocation`, `-A` | Show only the scratch org allocation (Active/Daily). |
| `--list-scratch`, `-l` | List active scratch orgs created from this Dev Hub. |
| `--enable`, `-e` | Enable Dev Hub (deploys `enableScratchOrgManagementPref=true`). Dry run unless `--apply`. |
| `--configure`, `-c` | Configure sub-preferences without (re)enabling the master switch. Pair with a pref flag. |
| `--packaging` | `enablePackaging2=true` (Unlocked + 2GP packages). |
| `--snapshots` | `enableScratchOrgSnapshotPref=true`. |
| `--shape` | `enableShapeExportPref=true`. |
| `--scratch-management` | `enableScratchOrgManagementPref=true` (the Dev Hub switch). |
| `--pref KEY=VALUE` | Any `DevHubSettings` sub-pref (KEY starts with `enable`, VALUE `true`/`false`). Repeatable. |
| `--apply` | Actually deploy to the explicit org argument. Default for `--enable`/`--configure` is a validate-only dry run. |
| `--login` | Authenticate an org first via `sf org login web` (opens a browser), then run the action. |
| `--instance-url <url>` | Log in to a specific instance (My Domain, sandbox, or pre-release/scratch instance) with `sf org login web --instance-url <url>`. Implies `--login`. |
| `--json` | Emit machine-readable JSON. |
| `--fail-if-disabled` | Exit `3` if Dev Hub is not enabled (CI/cron gate). |
| `--help`, `-h` | Show usage. |

`--enable` may be combined with sub-pref flags to enable and configure at once
(e.g. `--enable --packaging --apply`). If omitted, the org defaults to
`target-org`, then `target-dev-hub`.

## Output examples

The script prints the authoritative output at runtime. If you need to calibrate
what an enabled-vs-disabled status transcript looks like (including the
allocation table and the enable/Setup-UI guidance), read
[`examples/status-output.md`](examples/status-output.md) — otherwise skip it to
keep this workflow lean.

## Structured output for automation (`--json`)

Use `--json` in any mode for machine-readable output (no prose). Status returns
`devHubEnabled`, `status`, and an `allocation` object; enablement returns
`success`, `applied`, and `devHubVerifiedState`. Deterministic, no LLM needed.

```bash
bash "<skill_dir>/scripts/devhub.sh" my-devhub --json
# {"org":"my-devhub","devHubEnabled":true,"status":"enabled", ... }
```

`--fail-if-disabled` exits `3` (and prints an `ALERT:` line to stderr) if Dev
Hub is not enabled, so a scheduled job can gate on it.

## Exit codes

- `0` success
- `1` an org could not be queried, or a deploy failed (auth/connection/deploy)
- `2` bad usage or a missing dependency (`sf` or `jq`)
- `3` Dev Hub is not enabled (only when `--fail-if-disabled` is set)

## Authentication

If the org isn't authenticated yet, the skill can log in for you with
`--login` (or `--instance-url <url>`), then continue with the requested action
in the same run — this is the preferred path when the user provides an instance
URL:

Substitute the user's actual instance URL for `<url>` (shown here as the generic
`https://my-domain.my.salesforce.com` placeholder):

```bash
# Log in to a specific instance (My Domain / pre-release / sandbox), then enable:
bash "<skill_dir>/scripts/devhub.sh" my-alias \
  --instance-url https://my-domain.my.salesforce.com --enable --apply

# Bare instance URL as shorthand — logs in to it, then reports status:
bash "<skill_dir>/scripts/devhub.sh" https://my-domain.my.salesforce.com

# Just authenticate an org (no other action):
bash "<skill_dir>/scripts/devhub.sh" my-alias --login
```

`sf org login web` opens a browser for the OAuth flow; complete it promptly (the
session times out). A supplied positional (`my-alias`) becomes the CLI alias; a
positional that looks like a URL (contains `://`) is taken as the
`--instance-url` to log in to. The script accepts only HTTPS Salesforce-owned
hostnames for this option. Omit `--instance-url` for standard
production/DE/trial logins (`login.salesforce.com`). If the browser flow keeps
timing out, the script prints the `sf org login device` fallback for a
code-based login.

If an org isn't authenticated and no login flag was passed, the script instead
prints the exact command to log in and re-run — using the instance URL you
supplied when there is one:

```text
  my-org                         could not query org (...)

  To authenticate against https://my-domain.my.salesforce.com, run:
    sf org login web --instance-url "https://my-domain.my.salesforce.com" --alias "my-org"
  Or let this script log you in and continue in one step:
    devhub.sh "my-org" --instance-url "https://my-domain.my.salesforce.com" --login
  Then re-run. List existing logins with:  sf org list
```

## Manual fallback (if the script is unavailable)

```bash
# Detect Dev Hub (INVALID_TYPE error means OFF; a count means ON):
sf data query --query "SELECT COUNT() FROM ScratchOrgInfo" --target-org <org> --json

# Enable Dev Hub via the Tooling API (what the Setup toggle does; irreversible):
sf api request rest "/services/data/v47.0/tooling/sobjects/DevHubSettings/DevHub" \
  --method PATCH \
  --body '{"FullName":"DevHub","Metadata":{"enableScratchOrgManagementPref":true}}' \
  --target-org <org>

# Or enable in the UI: Setup > Quick Find > "Dev Hub" > turn Enable Dev Hub On.

# View scratch org allocation:
sf org list limits --target-org <org> --json | jq '.result[] | select(.name|test("ScratchOrg"))'
```

## Notes

- Requires the Salesforce CLI (`sf`) and `jq` on the PATH, plus at least one
  authenticated org (`sf org login web`).
- After enabling, set the org as your default Dev Hub:
  `sf config set target-dev-hub <org>`.
- Enabling **packaging** (`enablePackaging2`) requires Dev Hub to be on first —
  `--enable --packaging` handles the ordering in a single deploy.
- Non-admin users still need object access (Read/Create on `ScratchOrgInfo` and
  `ActiveScratchOrg`) to create/view scratch orgs, and the "Create and Update
  Second-Generation Packages" permission to build 2GP/unlocked packages.
- To *switch* the default org use `dx-org-switch`; to check *expiration* use
  `dx-org-trial-expiration-check`.
