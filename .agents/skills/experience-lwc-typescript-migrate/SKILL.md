# Converting LWC to TypeScript

Convert a Lightning Web Component bundle from JavaScript to TypeScript. The
deliverable is a fully-typed `.ts` implementation **plus** a `.d.ts` file
that only exposes `@api` members (the public surface other LWCs consume).

## When to Use This Skill

- User wants to migrate a single component or a folder of components from
  `.js` to `.ts`.
- User needs a `.d.ts` for an existing LWC so other components (or an
  external TypeScript host) can import it safely.
- User is adding type annotations to an already-renamed `.ts` LWC that
  hasn't been properly typed yet.
- User wants JSDoc-style type hints upgraded to real TypeScript types.

## Prerequisites

- The component builds and runs correctly in JavaScript today.
- `git` is available (the rename must preserve history via `git mv`).
- A TypeScript compiler is wired into the build (either the SFDX TS
  pipeline or a standalone `tsc` step).

---

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Read the component

Open every file in the bundle:

```text
componentName/
├── componentName.js
├── componentName.html
├── componentName.css
└── (possibly) __tests__/, __utam__/, existing .d.ts
```

Understand:

- What extends `LightningElement`? What is the class name?
- Which fields and methods carry the `@api` decorator?
- Which properties/methods have existing JSDoc (use as a type hint
  starting point, but validate against actual usage — JSDoc lies).
- Which parameters / return types can you infer from how the code is
  called internally?

### Step 2 — Rename `.js` → `.ts` using `git mv`

```bash
git mv componentName/componentName.js componentName/componentName.ts
```

Repeat for any helper `.js` files in the bundle (unless they're already
`.ts`). **Never** plain `mv` — that loses the history link TypeScript
reviewers rely on.

### Step 3 — Add type annotations in the `.ts`

Apply types in this priority order so you stop as soon as the public
contract is solid:

1. **`@api` properties and methods first.** Generate JSDoc if it's
   missing, then translate JSDoc types to TS syntax (`string`, `number`,
   `boolean`, `Promise<T>`). Validate each JSDoc claim against the code
   before trusting it.
2. **Complex shapes become `interface` or `type` aliases** — not inline
   shapes repeated everywhere.
3. **Optional members use `?`** only when the value is genuinely allowed
   to be `undefined`. Do not sprinkle `?` defensively.
4. **Private/internal state** — still type it, but don't export the
   types. Use `private` for members that must never be touched by
   consumers.
5. **Event handlers** — prefer precise DOM event types:
   - `MouseEvent` for `onclick` (and other click-like handlers). `click`
     is dispatched as a `MouseEvent` — including keyboard-activated
     clicks — so typing it as `PointerEvent` would let handlers rely on
     pointer-only fields (`pointerType`, `pressure`, etc.) that are
     undefined in those cases.
   - `PointerEvent` for `onpointerdown` / `onpointerup` / `onpointermove`
     and other `pointer*` handlers where pointer-specific fields are
     actually meaningful.
   - `CustomEvent<{ detail: ... }>` for LWC custom events.
   - `Event` is the last resort; document why when using it.
6. **Async methods** always return `Promise<T>` — never bare `T`.
7. **Avoid `any`.** If you genuinely can't type something, use `unknown`
   and narrow with a type guard.

#### Reference patterns

Load [[assets/type-patterns.ts|assets/type-patterns.ts]] as an inline example
covering property types, method types, and event handler types.

### Step 4 — Generate the `.d.ts`

Create `componentName.d.ts` next to the `.ts`. It must:

- Contain **only `@api` members** — no private state, no internal
  methods, no lifecycle hooks unless they are themselves `@api`.
- Preserve `@api` JSDoc verbatim (including `@type`, `@required`,
  `@default`, `@param`, `@returns` tags) directly above each declaration.
- Declare the LWC module namespace `c/componentName` (or the org's
  namespace if different).

Template: load [[assets/dts-template.ts|assets/dts-template.ts]] as the
starting `.d.ts` shape.

If the component has **no** `@api` members, still produce the module
declaration with a comment explaining there's no public surface — don't
skip the file.

### Step 5 — Compile and test

- Run the TypeScript compiler (`tsc --noEmit` or the build's equivalent).
  Resolve every error before calling it done; no `@ts-ignore` patches.
- Run the component's existing Jest tests. The behavior should be
  identical.
- Run the bundled consumer-finder unconditionally — empty output is a
  valid result, not a reason to skip. The script resolves the search
  paths from `sfdx-project.json`'s `packageDirectories` (or falls back
  to `<project-root>`), rejects any entry that escapes the project root,
  and performs the LWC-import search internally so the invocation is
  fully deterministic:

```bash
"<skill_dir>/scripts/find-consumers.sh" "<project-root>" "<componentName>"
```

  For each match, confirm the consumer's expected types still align with
  the new `.d.ts` public surface.

### Step 6 — Expected final bundle shape

```text
componentName/
├── componentName.ts          # Main TypeScript implementation
├── componentName.html        # Template (unchanged)
├── componentName.css         # Styles (unchanged)
└── componentName.d.ts        # Type definitions (new)
```

## Verification Checklist

**Before conversion:**

- [ ] Component is valid JS and all tests pass.
- [ ] You've identified every `@api` member and its intended type.

**After conversion:**

- [ ] `git mv` was used so history is preserved.
- [ ] Every variable and parameter in the `.ts` has a concrete type
      (no implicit `any`).
- [ ] Complex object shapes live in `interface` / `type` aliases, not
      inline repeats.
- [ ] Optional `?` is only on genuinely optional fields.
- [ ] `.d.ts` exists, declares `c/componentName`, extends
      `LightningElement`, includes **only** `@api` members.
- [ ] Every `@api` JSDoc is preserved verbatim in the `.d.ts`.
- [ ] `tsc` passes with zero errors; no `@ts-ignore` or `any` used as a
      workaround.
- [ ] Jest tests still pass.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Using `any` to silence errors.** Solve the actual type instead.
  If the value is truly unknown, use `unknown` + a type guard.
- **Including private members in the `.d.ts`.** The `.d.ts` is the
  public contract. Internal lifecycle and helpers must not leak.
- **Losing JSDoc during the rename.** Scan before and after — JSDoc
  comments on `@api` members must appear in both the `.ts` and `.d.ts`.
- **Skipping `git mv`.** Makes review miserable and confuses blame.
- **Forgetting async return types.** `foo()` with an `async` keyword
  always returns a `Promise`. Declare it.
- **Typing `onclick` as `PointerEvent`.** `click` is a `MouseEvent`
  (keyboard-triggered clicks included), so `PointerEvent` fields like
  `pointerType` are undefined for those events. Type `onclick` as
  `MouseEvent`; reserve `PointerEvent` for `onpointer*` handlers. Use
  `MouseEvent | TouchEvent` only when the code branches on `TouchEvent`
  distinctly.
