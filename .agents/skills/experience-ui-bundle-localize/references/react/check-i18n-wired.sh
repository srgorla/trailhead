# check-i18n-wired.sh — Confirm the React i18next init exists and is called at boot.
#
# React-specific: the manifest -> backendOptions / SalesforceBackend detection is
# i18next-shaped and has no ngx-translate analog, so this script lives under the
# React reference (references/react/) rather than the shared scripts/ folder. The
# Angular equivalent is authored separately under references/angular/.
#
# Whether the app already has i18n wiring is a file-existence plus call-site
# check, so run this rather than reading for it by hand. It looks for an init
# file that defines initI18n() and for a boot-time initI18n() call in an entry
# file.
#
# Usage (run from the UI bundle dir, or pass its src path):
#   bash <skill-dir>/references/react/check-i18n-wired.sh [src-dir]
#
# src-dir defaults to "src".
#
# When wiring exists, it also reports whether the label manifest is imported AND
# actually passed into the SalesforceBackend's backendOptions (not merely
# imported and left unused), so the reconcile decision is a script result rather
# than a by-hand read.
#
# Exit codes (each actionable state has its own code so the workflow branches on
# the code, not on the message text):
#   0  fully wired — initI18n() defined, called at boot, AND the manifest is
#      passed into the SalesforceBackend's backendOptions. Just add new keys.
#   1  no i18n init found — no initI18n() definition. Scaffold the whole setup
#      (see references/react/i18n-setup.md).
#   2  init defined but not called at boot — add only the boot-time initI18n()
#      call in the entry file; do NOT re-scaffold or overwrite the init.
#   3  wired at boot but the manifest could not be confirmed as passed into the
#      backend (not imported, no backendOptions/SalesforceBackend config, or
#      imported but not seen inside a backendOptions array). This is a textual
#      heuristic: the manifest may be wired via a variable/spread this check
#      cannot see. VERIFY by hand; reconcile only if it genuinely dangles, and
#      never clobber the existing init.
#  64  usage error — the source dir does not exist (bad argument or wrong cwd).
#      This is NOT a "no init found" result; do not scaffold. Fix the path and
#      re-run. (64 = EX_USAGE, kept out of the 0-3 semantic range so exit 1
#      uniquely means "no init found".)
# The message still names the specific file/symbol/gap for the report, but the
# decision is the exit code.
